# Job 25

## God's Majesty and Human Worthlessness
¶[Job 25:1] Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:

¶[Job 25:2] “Dominion and awesome might belong to God; he establishes peace in his heights.
[Job 25:3] Can his armies be numbered? On whom does his light not rise?
[Job 25:4] How then can a human being be righteous before God? How can one born of a woman be pure?
[Job 25:5] If even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned,
[Job 25:6] how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot – a son of man, who is only a worm!”
