# Job 40

## Job's Response
¶[Job 40:1] Then the Lord answered Job:

¶[Job 40:2] “Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let the person who accuses God give him an answer!”

¶[Job 40:3] Then Job answered the Lord:

¶[Job 40:4] “Indeed, I am completely unworthy – how could I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth to silence myself.
[Job 40:5] I have spoken once, but I cannot answer; twice, but I will say no more.”

## Lessons from Behemoth and Leviathan
¶[Job 40:6] Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind:

¶[Job 40:7] “Get ready for a difficult task like a man. I will question you and you will inform me!
[Job 40:8] Would you indeed annul my justice? Would you declare me guilty so that you might be right?
[Job 40:9] Do you have an arm as powerful as God’s, and can you thunder with a voice like his?
[Job 40:10] Adorn yourself, then, with majesty and excellency, and clothe yourself with glory and honor!
[Job 40:11] Scatter abroad the abundance of your anger. Look at every proud man and bring him low;
[Job 40:12] Look at every proud man and abase him; crush the wicked on the spot!
[Job 40:13] Hide them in the dust together, imprison them in the grave.
[Job 40:14] Then I myself will acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you.
[Job 40:15] “Look now at Behemoth, which I made as I made you; it eats grass like the ox.
[Job 40:16] Look at its strength in its loins, and its power in the muscles of its belly.
[Job 40:17] It makes its tail stiff like a cedar, the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound.
[Job 40:18] Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like bars of iron.
[Job 40:19] It ranks first among the works of God, the One who made it has furnished it with a sword.
[Job 40:20] For the hills bring it food, where all the wild animals play.
[Job 40:21] Under the lotus trees it lies, in the secrecy of the reeds and the marsh.
[Job 40:22] The lotus trees conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream conceal it.
[Job 40:23] If the river rages, it is not disturbed, it is secure, though the Jordan should surge up to its mouth.
[Job 40:24] Can anyone catch it by its eyes, or pierce its nose with a snare?
