# Psalms 4

## Introduction: Call for the Lord's Answer
¶`Ps 4:1` For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David. When I call out, answer me, O God who vindicates me! Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place. Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer!

## Warning and Admonishment to the Troublemakers
¶`Ps 4:2` You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame? How long will you love what is worthless and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)

## Assurance of God's Favor to the Righteous
¶`Ps 4:3` Realize that the Lord shows the godly special favor; the Lord responds when I cry out to him.

## Encouragement for the Faithful
¶`Ps 4:4` Tremble with fear and do not sin! Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways! (Selah)
`Ps 4:5` Offer the prescribed sacrifices and trust in the Lord!

## The Contrast between the Faithless and the Faithful
¶`Ps 4:6` Many say, “Who can show us anything good?” Smile upon us, Lord!
`Ps 4:7` You make me happier than those who have abundant grain and wine.

## Trust in the Lord's Protection and Peace
¶`Ps 4:8` I will lie down and sleep peacefully, for you, Lord, make me safe and secure.
