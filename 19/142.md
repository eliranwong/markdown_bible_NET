# Psalms 142

## Introduction: A Cry for Help
¶[Ps 142:1] A well-written song by David, when he was in the cave; a prayer. To the Lord I cry out; to the Lord I plead for mercy.

## David's Desperation and Trust in God
¶[Ps 142:2] I pour out my lament before him; I tell him about my troubles.
[Ps 142:3] Even when my strength leaves me, you watch my footsteps. In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.

## Finding Solace in God Amidst Loneliness
¶[Ps 142:4] Look to the right and see! No one cares about me. I have nowhere to run; no one is concerned about my life.

## David's Declaration of Dependence on God
¶[Ps 142:5] I cry out to you, O Lord; I say, “You are my shelter, my security in the land of the living.”

## David's Prayer for Deliverance
¶[Ps 142:6] Listen to my cry for help, for I am in serious trouble! Rescue me from those who chase me, for they are stronger than I am.
[Ps 142:7] Free me from prison, that I may give thanks to your name. Because of me the godly will assemble, for you will vindicate me.
