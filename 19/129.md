# Psalms 129

## The Perseverance of Israel
¶[Ps 129:1] A song of ascents. “Since my youth they have often attacked me,” let Israel say.
[Ps 129:2] “Since my youth they have often attacked me, but they have not defeated me.

## The Plight of the Oppressors
¶[Ps 129:3] The plowers plowed my back; they made their furrows long.
[Ps 129:4] The Lord is just; he cut the ropes of the wicked.”

## The Curse on the Wicked
¶[Ps 129:5] May all who hate Zion be humiliated and turned back!
[Ps 129:6] May they be like the grass on the rooftops which withers before one can even pull it up,
[Ps 129:7] which cannot fill the reaper’s hand, or the lap of the one who gathers the grain!

## The Declaration of Confidence
¶[Ps 129:8] Those who pass by will not say, “May you experience the Lord’s blessing! We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the Lord.
