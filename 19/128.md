# Psalms 128

## Blessings for Those Who Fear the Lord
¶[Ps 128:1] A song of ascents. How blessed is every one of the Lord’s loyal followers, each one who keeps his commands!
[Ps 128:2] You will eat what you worked so hard to grow. You will be blessed and secure.

## The Blessings of Family Life
¶[Ps 128:3] Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the inner rooms of your house; your children will be like olive branches, as they sit all around your table.
[Ps 128:4] Yes indeed, the man who fears the Lord will be blessed in this way.

## The Promise of God's Blessings and Well-being
¶[Ps 128:5] May the Lord bless you from Zion, that you might see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life,
[Ps 128:6] and that you might see your grandchildren. May Israel experience peace!
