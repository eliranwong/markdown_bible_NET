# Psalms 101

## Introduction: A Psalm of Praise and Commitment
¶[Ps 101:1] A psalm of David. I will sing about loyalty and justice! To you, O Lord, I will sing praises!
[Ps 101:2] I will walk in the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will conduct my business with integrity in the midst of my palace.

## Rejecting Evil
¶[Ps 101:3] I will not even consider doing what is dishonest. I hate doing evil; I will have no part of it.
[Ps 101:4] I will have nothing to do with a perverse person; I will not permit evil.

## Associating with the Righteous
¶[Ps 101:5] I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret. I will not tolerate anyone who has a haughty demeanor and an arrogant attitude.
[Ps 101:6] I will favor the honest people of the land, and allow them to live with me. Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me.

## Eliminating Wickedness from the Kingdom
¶[Ps 101:7] Deceitful people will not live in my palace. Liars will not be welcome in my presence.
[Ps 101:8] Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land, and remove all evildoers from the city of the Lord.
