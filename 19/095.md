# Psalms 95

## Introductory Call to Worship
¶[Ps 95:1] Come! Let’s sing for joy to the Lord! Let’s shout out praises to our protector who delivers us!
[Ps 95:2] Let’s enter his presence with thanksgiving! Let’s shout out to him in celebration!

## Reasons for Worship
¶[Ps 95:3] For the Lord is a great God, a great king who is superior to all gods.
[Ps 95:4] The depths of the earth are in his hand, and the mountain peaks belong to him.
[Ps 95:5] The sea is his, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land.

## Submission to God and Worship
¶[Ps 95:6] Come! Let’s bow down and worship! Let’s kneel before the Lord, our Creator!
[Ps 95:7] For he is our God; we are the people of his pasture, the sheep he owns. Today, if only you would obey him!

## Warning Against Disobedience
¶[Ps 95:8] He says, “Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah, like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness,
[Ps 95:9] where your ancestors challenged my authority, and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work.
[Ps 95:10] For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation, and I said, ‘These people desire to go astray; they do not obey my commands.’
[Ps 95:11] So I made a vow in my anger, ‘They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for them.’”
