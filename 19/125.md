# Psalms 125

## Trust in the Lord as the Steadfast Foundation
¶`Ps 125:1` A song of ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved and will endure forever.

## God's Protection and Presence
¶`Ps 125:2` As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the Lord surrounds his people, now and forevermore.

## Righteousness and Peace for God's People
¶`Ps 125:3` Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle upon the allotted land of the godly. Otherwise the godly might do what is wrong.

## Prayers for the Faithful and Righteous
¶`Ps 125:4` Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, to the morally upright!

## The Separation of Good and Evil
¶`Ps 125:5` As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path, may the Lord remove them, along with those who behave wickedly! May Israel experience peace!
