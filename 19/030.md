# Psalms 30

## Introduction: A Psalm of Thankfulness and Praise
¶`Ps 30:1` A psalm – a song used at the dedication of the temple; by David. I will praise you, O Lord, for you lifted me up, and did not allow my enemies to gloat over me.
`Ps 30:2` O Lord my God, I cried out to you and you healed me.
`Ps 30:3` O Lord, you pulled me up from Sheol; you rescued me from among those descending into the grave.
`Ps 30:4` Sing to the Lord, you faithful followers of his; give thanks to his holy name.
`Ps 30:5` For his anger lasts only a brief moment, and his good favor restores one’s life. One may experience sorrow during the night, but joy arrives in the morning.

## The Confidence in God's Blessing
¶`Ps 30:6` In my self-confidence I said, “I will never be shaken.”
`Ps 30:7` O Lord, in your good favor you made me secure. Then you rejected me and I was terrified.

## The Desperation and Plea for God's Mercy
¶`Ps 30:8` To you, O Lord, I cried out; I begged the Lord for mercy:
`Ps 30:9` “What profit is there in taking my life, in my descending into the Pit? Can the dust of the grave praise you? Can it declare your loyalty?
`Ps 30:10` Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me! O Lord, deliver me!”

## The Transformation from Mourning to Joy
¶`Ps 30:11` Then you turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy.
`Ps 30:12` So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent; O Lord my God, I will always give thanks to you.
