# Psalms 1

## Introduction to the Two Ways of Life
¶`Ps 1:1` How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand in the pathway with sinners, or sit in the assembly of scoffers!

## The Character and Conduct of the Righteous
¶`Ps 1:2` Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lord’s commands; he meditates on his commands day and night.
`Ps 1:3` He is like a tree planted by flowing streams; it yields its fruit at the proper time, and its leaves never fall off. He succeeds in everything he attempts.

## The Character and Consequences of the Wicked
¶`Ps 1:4` Not so with the wicked! Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
`Ps 1:5` For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment, nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.

## The Divine Verdict
¶`Ps 1:6` Certainly the Lord guards the way of the godly, but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
