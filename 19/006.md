# Psalms 6

## Repentant plea for God's mercy
¶`Ps 6:1` For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David. Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger! Do not discipline me in your raging fury!
`Ps 6:2` Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am frail! Heal me, Lord, for my bones are shaking!
`Ps 6:3` I am absolutely terrified, and you, Lord – how long will this continue?

## Prayer for salvation rooted in faith
¶`Ps 6:4` Relent, Lord, rescue me! Deliver me because of your faithfulness!
`Ps 6:5` For no one remembers you in the realm of death, In Sheol who gives you thanks?

## Expressions of anguish and sorrow
¶`Ps 6:6` I am exhausted as I groan; all night long I drench my bed in tears; my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.
`Ps 6:7` My eyes grow dim from suffering; they grow weak because of all my enemies.

## Proclamation of victory and assurance
¶`Ps 6:8` Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping!
`Ps 6:9` The Lord has heard my appeal for mercy; the Lord has accepted my prayer.
`Ps 6:10` They will be humiliated and absolutely terrified! All my enemies will turn back and be suddenly humiliated!
