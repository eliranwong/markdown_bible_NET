# Psalms 23

## The Lord as the Shepherd
¶[Ps 23:1] A psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
[Ps 23:2] He takes me to lush pastures, he leads me to refreshing water.
[Ps 23:3] He restores my strength. He leads me down the right paths for the sake of his reputation.

## The Lord as the Protector and Comforter
¶[Ps 23:4] Even when I must walk through the darkest valley, I fear no danger, for you are with me; your rod and your staff reassure me.
[Ps 23:5] You prepare a feast before me in plain sight of my enemies. You refresh my head with oil; my cup is completely full.

## The Lord as the Source of Everlasting Goodness and Mercy
¶[Ps 23:6] Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all my days, and I will live in the Lord’s house for the rest of my life.
