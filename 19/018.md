# Psalms 18

## Introduction: Title and Praise to God
¶[Ps 18:1] For the music director; by the Lord’s servant David, who sang to the Lord the words of this song when the Lord rescued him from the power of all his enemies, including Saul. He said: “I love you, Lord, my source of strength!
[Ps 18:2] The Lord is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer. My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter, my shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge.
[Ps 18:3] I called to the Lord, who is worthy of praise, and I was delivered from my enemies.

## The Righteous Cry and God's Response
¶[Ps 18:4] The waves of death engulfed me, the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.
[Ps 18:5] The ropes of Sheol tightened around me, the snares of death trapped me.
[Ps 18:6] In my distress I called to the Lord; I cried out to my God. From his heavenly temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help.
[Ps 18:7] The earth heaved and shook; the roots of the mountains trembled; they heaved because he was angry.
[Ps 18:8] Smoke ascended from his nose; fire devoured as it came from his mouth; he hurled down fiery coals.
[Ps 18:9] He made the sky sink as he descended; a thick cloud was under his feet.
[Ps 18:10] He mounted a winged angel and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind.
[Ps 18:11] He shrouded himself in darkness, in thick rain clouds.
[Ps 18:12] From the brightness in front of him came hail and fiery coals.
[Ps 18:13] The Lord thundered in the sky; the Most High shouted.
[Ps 18:14] He shot his arrows and scattered them, many lightning bolts and routed them.
[Ps 18:15] The depths of the sea were exposed; the inner regions of the world were uncovered by your battle cry, Lord, by the powerful breath from your nose.
[Ps 18:16] He reached down from above and took hold of me; he pulled me from the surging water.
[Ps 18:17] He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hate me, for they were too strong for me.
[Ps 18:18] They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the Lord helped me.
[Ps 18:19] He brought me out into a wide open place; he delivered me because he was pleased with me.

## The Basis of God's Deliverance
¶[Ps 18:20] The Lord repaid me for my godly deeds; he rewarded my blameless behavior.
[Ps 18:21] For I have obeyed the Lord’s commands; I have not rebelled against my God.
[Ps 18:22] For I am aware of all his regulations, and I do not reject his rules.
[Ps 18:23] I was innocent before him, and kept myself from sinning.
[Ps 18:24] The Lord rewarded me for my godly deeds; he took notice of my blameless behavior.

## God's Dealings with People According to Their Character
¶[Ps 18:25] You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful; you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent.
[Ps 18:26] You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless, but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse.
[Ps 18:27] For you deliver oppressed people, but you bring down those who have a proud look.
[Ps 18:28] Indeed, you light my lamp, Lord. My God illuminates the darkness around me.
[Ps 18:29] Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army; by my God’s power I can jump over a wall.

## God's Mighty Acts of Deliverance
¶[Ps 18:30] The one true God acts in a faithful manner; the Lord’s promise is reliable; he is a shield to all who take shelter in him.
[Ps 18:31] Indeed, who is God besides the Lord? Who is a protector besides our God?
[Ps 18:32] The one true God gives me strength; he removes the obstacles in my way.
[Ps 18:33] He gives me the agility of a deer; he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
[Ps 18:34] He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend even the strongest bow.
[Ps 18:35] You give me your protective shield; your right hand supports me; your willingness to help enables me to prevail.
[Ps 18:36] You widen my path; my feet do not slip.
[Ps 18:37] I chase my enemies and catch them; I do not turn back until I wipe them out.
[Ps 18:38] I beat them to death; they fall at my feet.
[Ps 18:39] You give me strength for battle; you make my foes kneel before me.
[Ps 18:40] You make my enemies retreat; I destroy those who hate me.
[Ps 18:41] They cry out, but there is no one to help them; they cry out to the Lord, but he does not answer them.
[Ps 18:42] I grind them as fine windblown dust; I beat them underfoot like clay in the streets.
[Ps 18:43] You rescue me from a hostile army; you make me a leader of nations; people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects.
[Ps 18:44] When they hear of my exploits, they submit to me. Foreigners are powerless before me;
[Ps 18:45] foreigners lose their courage; they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds.

## The Conclusion: Exalting God and Celebrating His Faithfulness

[Ps 18:47] The one true God completely vindicates me; he makes nations submit to me.
[Ps 18:48] He delivers me from my enemies; you snatch me away from those who attack me; you rescue me from violent men.
[Ps 18:49] So I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord! I will sing praises to you!
[Ps 18:50] He gives his king magnificent victories; he is faithful to his chosen ruler, to David and his descendants forever.”
