# Psalms 58

## Introduction
¶[Ps 58:1] For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David. Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions? Do you judge people fairly?
[Ps 58:2] No! You plan how to do what is unjust; you deal out violence in the earth.

## Evils of the Wicked
¶[Ps 58:3] The wicked turn aside from birth; liars go astray as soon as they are born.
[Ps 58:4] Their venom is like that of a snake, like a deaf serpent that does not hear,
[Ps 58:5] that does not respond to the magicians, or to a skilled snake charmer.

## Judgment Against the Wicked
¶[Ps 58:6] O God, break the teeth in their mouths! Smash the jawbones of the lions, O Lord!
[Ps 58:7] Let them disappear like water that flows away! Let them wither like grass!
[Ps 58:8] Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves along! Let them be like stillborn babies that never see the sun!
[Ps 58:9] Before the kindling is even placed under your pots, he will sweep it away along with both the raw and cooked meat.

## Righteousness Triumphs
¶[Ps 58:10] The godly will rejoice when they see vengeance carried out; they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
[Ps 58:11] Then observers will say, “Yes indeed, the godly are rewarded! Yes indeed, there is a God who judges in the earth!”
