# Psalms 64

## Introduction: A Cry for Protection
¶`Ps 64:1` For the music director; a psalm of David. Listen to me, O God, as I offer my lament! Protect my life from the enemy’s terrifying attacks.

## The Wicked's Evil Plans
¶`Ps 64:2` Hide me from the plots of evil men, from the crowd of evildoers.
`Ps 64:3` They sharpen their tongues like a sword; they aim their arrow, a slanderous charge,
`Ps 64:4` in order to shoot down the innocent in secluded places. They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation.

## The Sinister Schemes of the Wicked
¶`Ps 64:5` They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed. They plan how to hide snares, and boast, “Who will see them?”
`Ps 64:6` They devise unjust schemes; they disguise a well-conceived plot. Man’s inner thoughts cannot be discovered.

## God's Decisive Response to the Wicked
¶`Ps 64:7` But God will shoot at them; suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow.
`Ps 64:8` Their slander will bring about their demise. All who see them will shudder,
`Ps 64:9` and all people will fear. They will proclaim what God has done, and reflect on his deeds.

## Righteous Rejoicing in God's Judgment
¶`Ps 64:10` The godly will rejoice in the Lord and take shelter in him. All the morally upright will boast.
