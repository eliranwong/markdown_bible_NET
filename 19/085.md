# Psalms 85

## Supplication for God's favor
¶`Ps 85:1` For the music director; written by the Korahites, a psalm. O Lord, you showed favor to your land; you restored the well-being of Jacob.
`Ps 85:2` You pardoned the wrongdoing of your people; you forgave all their sin. (Selah)
`Ps 85:3` You withdrew all your fury; you turned back from your raging anger.

## Prayer for the restoration of God's presence
¶`Ps 85:4` Restore us, O God our deliverer! Do not be displeased with us!
`Ps 85:5` Will you stay mad at us forever? Will you remain angry throughout future generations?
`Ps 85:6` Will you not revive us once more? Then your people will rejoice in you!
`Ps 85:7` O Lord, show us your loyal love! Bestow on us your deliverance!

## The anticipated manifestation of God's loving-kindness
¶`Ps 85:8` I will listen to what God the Lord says. For he will make peace with his people, his faithful followers. Yet they must not return to their foolish ways.
`Ps 85:9` Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance; then his splendor will again appear in our land.
`Ps 85:10` Loyal love and faithfulness meet; deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.
`Ps 85:11` Faithfulness grows from the ground, and deliverance looks down from the sky.
`Ps 85:12` Yes, the Lord will bestow his good blessings, and our land will yield its crops.
`Ps 85:13` Deliverance goes before him, and prepares a pathway for him.
