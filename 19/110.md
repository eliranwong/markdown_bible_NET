# Psalms 110

## Introduction: Declaration of Divine Enthronement
¶[Ps 110:1] A psalm of David. Here is the Lord’s proclamation to my lord: “Sit down at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool!”

## The Messiah's Reign
¶[Ps 110:2] The Lord extends your dominion from Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies!
[Ps 110:3] Your people willingly follow you when you go into battle. On the holy hills at sunrise the dew of your youth belongs to you.

## The Messiah as Eternal Priest
¶[Ps 110:4] The Lord makes this promise on oath and will not revoke it: “You are an eternal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek.”

## The Messiah's Victorious Judgment
¶[Ps 110:5] O Lord, at your right hand he strikes down kings in the day he unleashes his anger.
[Ps 110:6] He executes judgment against the nations; he fills the valleys with corpses; he shatters their heads over the vast battlefield.
[Ps 110:7] From the stream along the road he drinks; then he lifts up his head.
