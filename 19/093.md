# Psalms 93

## The Majesty of God's Reign
¶`Ps 93:1` The Lord reigns! He is robed in majesty, the Lord is robed, he wears strength around his waist. Indeed, the world is established, it cannot be moved.

## The Certainty of God's Creation
¶`Ps 93:2` Your throne has been secure from ancient times; you have always been king.

## The Power of God Over the Waters
¶`Ps 93:3` The waves roar, O Lord, the waves roar, the waves roar and crash.
`Ps 93:4` Above the sound of the surging water, and the mighty waves of the sea, the Lord sits enthroned in majesty.

## The Holiness of God's House
¶`Ps 93:5` The rules you set down are completely reliable. Holiness aptly adorns your house, O Lord, forever.
