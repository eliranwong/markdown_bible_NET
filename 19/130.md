# Psalms 130

## Opening Cry for Mercy
¶[Ps 130:1] A song of ascents. From the deep water I cry out to you, O Lord.
[Ps 130:2] O Lord, listen to me! Pay attention to my plea for mercy!

## Recognition of God's Forgiveness
¶[Ps 130:3] If you, O Lord, were to keep track of sins, O Lord, who could stand before you?
[Ps 130:4] But you are willing to forgive, so that you might be honored.

## Waiting and Hoping in the Lord
¶[Ps 130:5] I rely on the Lord, I rely on him with my whole being; I wait for his assuring word.
[Ps 130:6] I yearn for the Lord, more than watchmen do for the morning, yes, more than watchmen do for the morning.

## Call to the People to Hope in God's Redemption
¶[Ps 130:7] O Israel, hope in the Lord, for the Lord exhibits loyal love, and is more than willing to deliver.
[Ps 130:8] He will deliver Israel from all their sins.
