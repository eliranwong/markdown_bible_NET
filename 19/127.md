# Psalms 127

## The Futility of Human Efforts without the Lord's Blessing
¶[Ps 127:1] A song of ascents, by Solomon. If the Lord does not build a house, then those who build it work in vain. If the Lord does not guard a city, then the watchman stands guard in vain.
[Ps 127:2] It is vain for you to rise early, come home late, and work so hard for your food. Yes, he provides for those whom he loves even when they sleep.

## The Blessing of Children as a Gift from the Lord
¶[Ps 127:3] Yes, sons are a gift from the Lord, the fruit of the womb is a reward.
[Ps 127:4] Sons born during one’s youth are like arrows in a warrior’s hand.
[Ps 127:5] How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.
