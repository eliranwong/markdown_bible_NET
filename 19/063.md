# Psalms 63

## Longing for God
¶[Ps 63:1] A psalm of David, written when he was in the Judean wilderness. O God, you are my God! I long for you! My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

## Beholding God's Power and Glory
¶[Ps 63:2] Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you, and witnessed your power and splendor.
[Ps 63:3] Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself, my lips will praise you.
[Ps 63:4] For this reason I will praise you while I live; in your name I will lift up my hands.

## Meditating on God during the Night
¶[Ps 63:5] As if with choice meat you satisfy my soul. My mouth joyfully praises you,
[Ps 63:6] whenever I remember you on my bed, and think about you during the nighttime hours.

## Trusting in God while under Threat
¶[Ps 63:7] For you are my deliverer; under your wings I rejoice.
[Ps 63:8] My soul pursues you; your right hand upholds me.

## God's Judgment on the Wicked
¶[Ps 63:9] Enemies seek to destroy my life, but they will descend into the depths of the earth.
[Ps 63:10] Each one will be handed over to the sword; their corpses will be eaten by jackals.

## Rejoicing in God's Victory
¶[Ps 63:11] But the king will rejoice in God; everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast, for the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
