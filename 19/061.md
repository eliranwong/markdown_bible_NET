# Psalms 61

## Longing for God's Protection
¶[Ps 61:1] For the music director; to be played on a stringed instrument; written by David. O God, hear my cry for help! Pay attention to my prayer!
[Ps 61:2] From the most remote place on earth I call out to you in my despair. Lead me up to a rocky summit where I can be safe!

## Trust in God's Faithful Care
¶[Ps 61:3] Indeed, you are my shelter, a strong tower that protects me from the enemy.
[Ps 61:4] I will be a permanent guest in your home; I will find shelter in the protection of your wings. (Selah)

## Assurance of God's Everlasting Presence
¶[Ps 61:5] For you, O God, hear my vows; you grant me the reward that belongs to your loyal followers.
[Ps 61:6] Give the king long life! Make his lifetime span several generations!

## Praise for God's Trustworthiness
¶[Ps 61:7] May he reign forever before God! Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him.
[Ps 61:8] Then I will sing praises to your name continually, as I fulfill my vows day after day.
