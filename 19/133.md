# Psalms 133

## The Blessing of Unity
¶`Ps 133:1` A song of ascents, by David. Look! How good and how pleasant it is when brothers truly live in unity!
`Ps 133:2` It is like fine oil poured on the head which flows down the beard – Aaron’s beard, and then flows down his garments.
`Ps 133:3` It is like the dew of Hermon, which flows down upon the hills of Zion. Indeed, that is where the Lord has decreed a blessing will be available – eternal life.
