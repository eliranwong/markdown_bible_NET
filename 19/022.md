# Psalms 22

## Introduction: The Forsaken Messiah
¶[Ps 22:1] For the music director; according to the tune “Morning Doe;” a psalm of David. My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? I groan in prayer, but help seems far away.
[Ps 22:2] My God, I cry out during the day, but you do not answer, and during the night my prayers do not let up.

## In the Midst of Suffering: Faith and Trust
¶[Ps 22:3] You are holy; you sit as king receiving the praises of Israel.
[Ps 22:4] In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted in you and you rescued them.
[Ps 22:5] To you they cried out, and they were saved; in you they trusted and they were not disappointed.

## The Humiliation and Scorn of the Sufferer
¶[Ps 22:6] But I am a worm, not a man; people insult me and despise me.
[Ps 22:7] All who see me taunt me; they mock me and shake their heads.
[Ps 22:8] They say, “Commit yourself to the Lord! Let the Lord rescue him! Let the Lord deliver him, for he delights in him.”

## The Sufferer's Relationship with God since Childhood
¶[Ps 22:9] Yes, you are the one who brought me out from the womb and made me feel secure on my mother’s breasts.
[Ps 22:10] I have been dependent on you since birth; from the time I came out of my mother’s womb you have been my God.

## A Plea for God's Help in Distress
¶[Ps 22:11] Do not remain far away from me, for trouble is near and I have no one to help me.
[Ps 22:12] Many bulls surround me; powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in.
[Ps 22:13] They open their mouths to devour me like a roaring lion that rips its prey.

## The Physical and Emotional Torment of the Sufferer
¶[Ps 22:14] My strength drains away like water; all my bones are dislocated; my heart is like wax; it melts away inside me.
[Ps 22:15] The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to my gums. You set me in the dust of death.
[Ps 22:16] Yes, wild dogs surround me – a gang of evil men crowd around me; like a lion they pin my hands and feet.
[Ps 22:17] I can count all my bones; my enemies are gloating over me in triumph.
[Ps 22:18] They are dividing up my clothes among themselves; they are rolling dice for my garments.

## A Final Plea for Deliverance
¶[Ps 22:19] But you, O Lord, do not remain far away! You are my source of strength! Hurry and help me!
[Ps 22:20] Deliver me from the sword! Save my life from the claws of the wild dogs!
[Ps 22:21] Rescue me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the wild oxen! You have answered me!

## The Sufferer's Praise and Proclamation
¶[Ps 22:22] I will declare your name to my countrymen! In the middle of the assembly I will praise you!
[Ps 22:23] You loyal followers of the Lord, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! All you descendants of Israel, stand in awe of him!
[Ps 22:24] For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed; he did not ignore him; when he cried out to him, he responded.
[Ps 22:25] You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly; I will fulfill my promises before the Lord’s loyal followers.
[Ps 22:26] Let the oppressed eat and be filled! Let those who seek his help praise the Lord! May you live forever!
[Ps 22:27] Let all the people of the earth acknowledge the Lord and turn to him! Let all the nations worship you!

## Conclusion: The Far-Reaching Impact of the Sufferer's Deliverance
¶[Ps 22:28] For the Lord is king and rules over the nations.
[Ps 22:29] All of the thriving people of the earth will join the celebration and worship; all those who are descending into the grave will bow before him, including those who cannot preserve their lives.
[Ps 22:30] A whole generation will serve him; they will tell the next generation about the Lord.
[Ps 22:31] They will come and tell about his saving deeds; they will tell a future generation what he has accomplished.
