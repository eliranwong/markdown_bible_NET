# Psalms 76

## Introduction: God's Mighty Presence
¶[Ps 76:1] For the music director; to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song. God has revealed himself in Judah; in Israel his reputation is great.
[Ps 76:2] He lives in Salem; he dwells in Zion.
[Ps 76:3] There he shattered the arrows, the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)

## God's Powerful Judgment
¶[Ps 76:4] You shine brightly and reveal your majesty, as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.
[Ps 76:5] The bravehearted were plundered; they “fell asleep.” All the warriors were helpless.
[Ps 76:6] At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse “fell asleep.”

## God's Overwhelming Sovereignty
¶[Ps 76:7] You are awesome! Yes, you! Who can withstand your intense anger?
[Ps 76:8] From heaven you announced what their punishment would be. The earth was afraid and silent
[Ps 76:9] when God arose to execute judgment, and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
[Ps 76:10] Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise; you reveal your anger in full measure.

## Giving Praise and Glory to God
¶[Ps 76:11] Make vows to the Lord your God and repay them! Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!
[Ps 76:12] He humbles princes; the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.
