# Psalms 12

## Introduction: A Plea for Help
¶[Ps 12:1] For the music director; according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David. Deliver, Lord! For the godly have disappeared; people of integrity have vanished.

## Wickedness in Society
¶[Ps 12:2] People lie to one another; they flatter and deceive.
[Ps 12:3] May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts!
[Ps 12:4] They say, “We speak persuasively; we know how to flatter and boast. Who is our master?”

## God's Promise to Act
¶[Ps 12:5] “Because of the violence done to the oppressed, because of the painful cries of the needy, I will spring into action,” says the Lord. “I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.”

## The Pure Words of the Lord
¶[Ps 12:6] The Lord’s words are absolutely reliable. They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground, where it is thoroughly refined.

## Trust in God's Protection
¶[Ps 12:7] You, Lord, will protect them; you will continually shelter each one from these evil people,

## The Persistence of Wickedness
¶[Ps 12:8] for the wicked seem to be everywhere, when people promote evil.
