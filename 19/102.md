# Psalms 102

## Introduction: A Prayer of the Afflicted
¶[Ps 102:1] The prayer of an oppressed man, as he grows faint and pours out his lament before the Lord. O Lord, hear my prayer! Pay attention to my cry for help!
[Ps 102:2] Do not ignore me in my time of trouble! Listen to me! When I call out to you, quickly answer me!

## The Psalmist's Lament and Suffering
¶[Ps 102:3] For my days go up in smoke, and my bones are charred like a fireplace.
[Ps 102:4] My heart is parched and withered like grass, for I am unable to eat food.
[Ps 102:5] Because of the anxiety that makes me groan, my bones protrude from my skin.
[Ps 102:6] I am like an owl in the wilderness; I am like a screech owl among the ruins.
[Ps 102:7] I stay awake; I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
[Ps 102:8] All day long my enemies taunt me; those who mock me use my name in their curses.
[Ps 102:9] For I eat ashes as if they were bread, and mix my drink with my tears,
[Ps 102:10] because of your anger and raging fury. Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away.
[Ps 102:11] My days are coming to an end, and I am withered like grass.

## The Eternality and Mercy of God
¶[Ps 102:12] But you, O Lord, rule forever, and your reputation endures.
[Ps 102:13] You will rise up and have compassion on Zion. For it is time to have mercy on her, for the appointed time has come.
[Ps 102:14] Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones, and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.
[Ps 102:15] The nations will respect the reputation of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor,
[Ps 102:16] when the Lord rebuilds Zion, and reveals his splendor,
[Ps 102:17] when he responds to the prayer of the destitute, and does not reject their request.

## The Future Restoration of Zion
¶[Ps 102:18] The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations; people yet to be born will praise the Lord.
[Ps 102:19] For he will look down from his sanctuary above; from heaven the Lord will look toward earth,
[Ps 102:20] in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners, and to set free those condemned to die,
[Ps 102:21] so they may proclaim the name of the Lord in Zion, and praise him in Jerusalem,
[Ps 102:22] when the nations gather together, and the kingdoms pay tribute to the Lord.

## The Fragility of Human Life and God's Eternal Nature
¶[Ps 102:23] He has taken away my strength in the middle of life; he has cut short my days.
[Ps 102:24] I say, “O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life! You endure through all generations.
[Ps 102:25] In earlier times you established the earth; the skies are your handiwork.
[Ps 102:26] They will perish, but you will endure. They will wear out like a garment; like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear.
[Ps 102:27] But you remain; your years do not come to an end.
[Ps 102:28] The children of your servants will settle down here, and their descendants will live securely in your presence.”
