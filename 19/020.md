# Psalms 20

## Introduction: A prayer of confidence in God
¶[Ps 20:1] For the music director; a psalm of David. May the Lord answer you when you are in trouble; may the God of Jacob make you secure!
[Ps 20:2] May he send you help from his temple; from Zion may he give you support!

## Petitions and blessings for the king
¶[Ps 20:3] May he take notice of all your offerings; may he accept your burnt sacrifice! (Selah)
[Ps 20:4] May he grant your heart’s desire; may he bring all your plans to pass!
[Ps 20:5] Then we will shout for joy over your victory; we will rejoice in the name of our God! May the Lord grant all your requests!

## Assurance of the Lord's saving power
¶[Ps 20:6] Now I am sure that the Lord will deliver his chosen king; he will intervene for him from his holy heavenly temple, and display his mighty ability to deliver.
[Ps 20:7] Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we depend on the Lord our God.
[Ps 20:8] They will fall down, but we will stand firm.

## Conclusion: A final plea for continued salvation
¶[Ps 20:9] The Lord will deliver the king; he will answer us when we call to him for help!
