# Psalms 57

## Introduction: Prayer for Refuge
¶[Ps 57:1] For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David, written when he fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God! Have mercy on me! For in you I have taken shelter. In the shadow of your wings I take shelter until trouble passes.
[Ps 57:2] I cry out for help to God Most High, to the God who vindicates me.

## Personal Distress amidst Adversaries
¶[Ps 57:3] May he send help from heaven and deliver me from my enemies who hurl insults! (Selah) May God send his loyal love and faithfulness!
[Ps 57:4] I am surrounded by lions; I lie down among those who want to devour me; men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are a sharp sword.

## Confidence in God's Exaltation
¶[Ps 57:5] Rise up above the sky, O God! May your splendor cover the whole earth!
[Ps 57:6] They have prepared a net to trap me; I am discouraged. They have dug a pit for me. They will fall into it! (Selah)

## Commitment to Praise and Worship
¶[Ps 57:7] I am determined, O God! I am determined! I will sing and praise you!
[Ps 57:8] Awake, my soul! Awake, O stringed instrument and harp! I will wake up at dawn!
[Ps 57:9] I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord! I will sing praises to you before foreigners!
[Ps 57:10] For your loyal love extends beyond the sky, and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.

## Conclusion: Acknowledgment of God's Glory
