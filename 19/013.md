# Psalms 13

## Introduction: Cry for Help
¶`Ps 13:1` For the music director; a psalm of David. How long, Lord, will you continue to ignore me? How long will you pay no attention to me?
`Ps 13:2` How long must I worry, and suffer in broad daylight? How long will my enemy gloat over me?

## Supplication: David's Plea for Deliverance
¶`Ps 13:3` Look at me! Answer me, O Lord my God! Revive me, or else I will die!
`Ps 13:4` Then my enemy will say, “I have defeated him!” Then my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.

## Affirmation: Trust in God's Steadfast Love
¶`Ps 13:5` But I trust in your faithfulness. May I rejoice because of your deliverance!
`Ps 13:6` I will sing praises to the Lord when he vindicates me.
