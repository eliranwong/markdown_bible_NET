# Psalms 108

## Introduction
¶[Ps 108:1] A song, a psalm of David. I am determined, O God! I will sing and praise you with my whole heart.
[Ps 108:2] Awake, O stringed instrument and harp! I will wake up at dawn!

## Joyful Proclamation of God's Faithfulness
¶[Ps 108:3] I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord! I will sing praises to you before foreigners!
[Ps 108:4] For your loyal love extends beyond the sky, and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
[Ps 108:5] Rise up above the sky, O God! May your splendor cover the whole earth!

## God's Sovereignty over the Nations
¶[Ps 108:6] Deliver by your power and answer me, so that the ones you love may be safe.
[Ps 108:7] God has spoken in his sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem, the Valley of Succoth I will measure off.
[Ps 108:8] Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh! Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my royal scepter.
[Ps 108:9] Moab is my washbasin. I will make Edom serve me. I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”

## The Need for God's Assistance
¶[Ps 108:10] Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom?
[Ps 108:11] Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.

## Reliance on God's Strength
¶[Ps 108:12] Give us help against the enemy, for any help men might offer is futile.
[Ps 108:13] By God’s power we will conquer; he will trample down our enemies.
