# Psalms 131

## Assertion of Humility
¶`Ps 131:1` A song of ascents, by David. O Lord, my heart is not proud, nor do I have a haughty look. I do not have great aspirations, or concern myself with things that are beyond me.

## Comparison to a Weaned Child
¶`Ps 131:2` Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself like a weaned child with its mother; I am content like a young child.

## Encouragement to Trust in the Lord
¶`Ps 131:3` O Israel, hope in the Lord now and forevermore!
