# Psalms 54

## Introduction: Prayerful Cry for Deliverance
¶[Ps 54:1] For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a well-written song by David. It was written when the Ziphites came and informed Saul: “David is hiding with us.” O God, deliver me by your name! Vindicate me by your power!
[Ps 54:2] O God, listen to my prayer! Pay attention to what I say!

## Appeal for Protection from Oppressors
¶[Ps 54:3] For foreigners attack me; ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah)

## Confidence in God's Support and Vindication
¶[Ps 54:4] Look, God is my deliverer! The Lord is among those who support me.
[Ps 54:5] May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil! As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them!

## Expression of Gratitude for God's Deliverance
¶[Ps 54:6] With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you! I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good!
[Ps 54:7] Surely he rescues me from all trouble, and I triumph over my enemies.
