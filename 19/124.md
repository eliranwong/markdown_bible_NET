# Psalms 124

## Introduction: A Song of Ascent
¶[Ps 124:1] A song of ascents, by David. “If the Lord had not been on our side” – let Israel say this! –

## The Lord as Israel's Protector
¶[Ps 124:2] if the Lord had not been on our side, when men attacked us,
[Ps 124:3] they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger raged against us.
[Ps 124:4] The water would have overpowered us; the current would have overwhelmed us.
[Ps 124:5] The raging water would have overwhelmed us.

## Gratitude for Divine Deliverance
¶[Ps 124:6] The Lord deserves praise, for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth.
[Ps 124:7] We escaped with our lives, like a bird from a hunter’s snare. The snare broke, and we escaped.

## Conclusion: Dependence on the Lord
¶[Ps 124:8] Our deliverer is the Lord, the Creator of heaven and earth.
