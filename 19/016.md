¶`Ps 16:1` A prayer of David. Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.

## Fellowship with God's Righteous People and Respect for Their Beliefs
¶`Ps 16:3` As for God’s chosen people who are in the land, and the leading officials I admired so much –
`Ps 16:4` their troubles multiply; they desire other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods, nor will I make vows in the name of their gods.

## Recognition of God's Provision and Sovereignty

`Ps 16:8` I constantly trust in the Lord; because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

## Joy and Confidence in God's Presence
¶`Ps 16:9` So my heart rejoices and I am happy; My life is safe.
`Ps 16:10` You will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.

## Eternal Fulfillment and Joy in God's Holy Presence
