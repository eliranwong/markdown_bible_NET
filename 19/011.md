# Psalms 11

## Confident Faith in the Lord
¶[Ps 11:1] For the music director; by David. In the Lord I have taken shelter. How can you say to me, “Flee to a mountain like a bird!
[Ps 11:2] For look, the wicked prepare their bows, they put their arrows on the strings, to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright.
[Ps 11:3] When the foundations are destroyed, what can the godly accomplish?”

## God's Sovereign Presence and Actions
¶[Ps 11:4] The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord’s throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; his eyes examine all people.
[Ps 11:5] The Lord approves of the godly, but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence.
[Ps 11:6] May he rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked! A whirlwind is what they deserve!

## Assurance of God's Love and Righteousness
¶[Ps 11:7] Certainly the Lord is just; he rewards godly deeds; the upright will experience his favor.
