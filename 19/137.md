# Psalms 137

## Lamentation Over the Exile
¶[Ps 137:1] By the rivers of Babylon we sit down and weep when we remember Zion.
[Ps 137:2] On the poplars in her midst we hang our harps,
[Ps 137:3] for there our captors ask us to compose songs; those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying: “Sing for us a song about Zion!”
[Ps 137:4] How can we sing a song to the Lord in a foreign land?

## Vow to Never Forget Jerusalem
¶[Ps 137:5] If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand be crippled!
[Ps 137:6] May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth, if I do not remember you, and do not give Jerusalem priority over whatever gives me the most joy.

## Judgment on their Captors
¶[Ps 137:7] Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell. They said, “Tear it down, tear it down, right to its very foundation!”
[Ps 137:8] O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated! How blessed will be the one who repays you for what you dished out to us!
[Ps 137:9] How blessed will be the one who grabs your babies and smashes them on a rock!
