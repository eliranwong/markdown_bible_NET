# Psalms 149

## Praise to God for His salvation and Judgment
¶[Ps 149:1] Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song! Praise him in the assembly of the godly!
[Ps 149:2] Let Israel rejoice in their Creator! Let the people of Zion delight in their King!
[Ps 149:3] Let them praise his name with dancing! Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp!
[Ps 149:4] For the Lord takes delight in his people; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them.

## Praise and Worship through Action
¶[Ps 149:5] Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication! Let them shout for joy upon their beds!
[Ps 149:6] May the praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hands,

## God's People as His Instruments of Judgment
¶[Ps 149:7] in order to take revenge on the nations, and punish foreigners.
[Ps 149:8] They bind their kings in chains, and their nobles in iron shackles,
[Ps 149:9] and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced. All his loyal followers will be vindicated. Praise the Lord!
