# Psalms 36

## Introduction
¶[Ps 36:1] For the music director; written by the Lord’s servant, David; an oracle. An evil man is rebellious to the core. He does not fear God,

## Characteristics of the Unrighteous
¶[Ps 36:2] for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin.
[Ps 36:3] The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
[Ps 36:4] He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed; he is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is evil.

## Attributes of God
¶[Ps 36:5] O Lord, your loyal love reaches to the sky; your faithfulness to the clouds.
[Ps 36:6] Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you, Lord, preserve mankind and the animal kingdom.
[Ps 36:7] How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings.
[Ps 36:8] They are filled with food from your house, and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.
[Ps 36:9] For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.

## Prayer for God's Protection and Mercy
¶[Ps 36:10] Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers, and vindicate the morally upright!
[Ps 36:11] Do not let arrogant men overtake me, or let evil men make me homeless!

## Final Proclamation
¶[Ps 36:12] I can see the evildoers! They have fallen! They have been knocked down and are unable to get up!
