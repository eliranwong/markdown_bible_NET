# Psalms 106

## Introduction: Praise to the Lord
¶[Ps 106:1] Praise the Lord! Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, and his loyal love endures!
[Ps 106:2] Who can adequately recount the Lord’s mighty acts, or relate all his praiseworthy deeds?
[Ps 106:3] How blessed are those who promote justice, and do what is right all the time!
[Ps 106:4] Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people! Pay attention to me, when you deliver,
[Ps 106:5] so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, rejoice along with your nation, and boast along with the people who belong to you.

## Israel's History of Sin and God's Deliverance
¶[Ps 106:6] We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, we have done evil.
[Ps 106:7] Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds, they failed to remember your many acts of loyal love, and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
[Ps 106:8] Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation, that he might reveal his power.
[Ps 106:9] He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up; he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
[Ps 106:10] He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them, and rescued them from the power of the enemy.
[Ps 106:11] The water covered their enemies; not even one of them survived.
[Ps 106:12] They believed his promises; they sang praises to him.
[Ps 106:13] They quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions.
[Ps 106:14] In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; they challenged God in the wastelands.
[Ps 106:15] He granted their request, then struck them with a disease.
[Ps 106:16] In the camp they resented Moses, and Aaron, the Lord’s holy priest.
[Ps 106:17] The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it engulfed the group led by Abiram.
[Ps 106:18] Fire burned their group; the flames scorched the wicked.
[Ps 106:19] They made an image of a calf at Horeb, and worshiped a metal idol.
[Ps 106:20] They traded their majestic God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
[Ps 106:21] They rejected the God who delivered them, the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
[Ps 106:22] amazing feats in the land of Ham, mighty acts by the Red Sea.
[Ps 106:23] He threatened to destroy them, but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him and turned back his destructive anger.
[Ps 106:24] They rejected the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise.
[Ps 106:25] They grumbled in their tents; they did not obey the Lord.
[Ps 106:26] So he made a solemn vow that he would make them die in the wilderness,
[Ps 106:27] make their descendants die among the nations, and scatter them among foreign lands.
[Ps 106:28] They worshiped Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
[Ps 106:29] They made the Lord angry by their actions, and a plague broke out among them.
[Ps 106:30] Phinehas took a stand and intervened, and the plague subsided.
[Ps 106:31] This was credited to him as a righteous act for all generations to come.
[Ps 106:32] They made him angry by the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them,
[Ps 106:33] for they aroused his temper, and he spoke rashly.
[Ps 106:34] They did not destroy the nations, as the Lord had commanded them to do.
[Ps 106:35] They mixed in with the nations and learned their ways.
[Ps 106:36] They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
[Ps 106:37] They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
[Ps 106:38] They shed innocent blood – the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted by bloodshed.
[Ps 106:39] They were defiled by their deeds, and unfaithful in their actions.
[Ps 106:40] So the Lord was angry with his people and despised the people who belong to him.
[Ps 106:41] He handed them over to the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
[Ps 106:42] Their enemies oppressed them; they were subject to their authority.
[Ps 106:43] Many times he delivered them, but they had a rebellious attitude, and degraded themselves by their sin.
[Ps 106:44] Yet he took notice of their distress, when he heard their cry for help.
[Ps 106:45] He remembered his covenant with them, and relented because of his great loyal love.
[Ps 106:46] He caused all their conquerors to have pity on them.

## Closing Prayer for Restoration and Praise
¶[Ps 106:47] Deliver us, O Lord, our God! Gather us from among the nations! Then we will give thanks to your holy name, and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.
[Ps 106:48] The Lord God of Israel deserves praise, in the future and forevermore. Let all the people say, “We agree! Praise the Lord!”
