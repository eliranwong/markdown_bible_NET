# Psalms 2

## Introduction: The Nations Rebelling against God
¶[Ps 2:1] Why do the nations rebel? Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?
[Ps 2:2] The kings of the earth form a united front; the rulers collaborate against the Lord and his anointed king.
[Ps 2:3] They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us! Let’s free ourselves from their ropes!”

## God's Response to the Rebellion
¶[Ps 2:4] The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust; the Lord taunts them.
[Ps 2:5] Then he angrily speaks to them and terrifies them in his rage, saying,
[Ps 2:6] “I myself have installed my king on Zion, my holy hill.”

## The Proclamation of God's Decree
¶[Ps 2:7] The king says, “I will announce the Lord’s decree. He said to me: ‘You are my son! This very day I have become your father!
[Ps 2:8] Ask me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, the ends of the earth as your personal property.
[Ps 2:9] You will break them with an iron scepter; you will smash them like a potter’s jar!’”

## The Appeal to the Rulers and Nations
¶[Ps 2:10] So now, you kings, do what is wise; you rulers of the earth, submit to correction!
[Ps 2:11] Serve the Lord in fear! Repent in terror!
[Ps 2:12] Give sincere homage! Otherwise he will be angry, and you will die because of your behavior, when his anger quickly ignites. How blessed are all who take shelter in him!
