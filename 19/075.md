# Psalms 75

## Introduction: Gratitude for God's Wondrous Deeds
¶[Ps 75:1] For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a psalm of Asaph; a song. We give thanks to you, O God! We give thanks! You reveal your presence; people tell about your amazing deeds.
[Ps 75:2] God says, “At the appointed times, I judge fairly.
[Ps 75:3] When the earth and all its inhabitants dissolve in fear, I make its pillars secure.” (Selah)

## Warning Against Boasting and Arrogance
¶[Ps 75:4] I say to the proud, “Do not be proud,” and to the wicked, “Do not be so confident of victory!
[Ps 75:5] Do not be so certain you have won! Do not speak with your head held so high!
[Ps 75:6] For victory does not come from the east or west, or from the wilderness.
[Ps 75:7] For God is the judge! He brings one down and exalts another.
[Ps 75:8] For the Lord holds in his hand a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices, and pours it out. Surely all the wicked of the earth will slurp it up and drink it to its very last drop.”

## Resolute Praise and Commitment
¶[Ps 75:9] As for me, I will continually tell what you have done; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob!
[Ps 75:10] God says, “I will bring down all the power of the wicked; the godly will be victorious.”
