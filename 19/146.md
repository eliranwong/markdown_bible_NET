# Psalms 146

## Praise for God's Faithfulness and Enduring Love
¶[Ps 146:1] Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul!
[Ps 146:2] I will praise the Lord as long as I live! I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist!

## Warning against Trusting in Mere Mortals
¶[Ps 146:3] Do not trust in princes, or in human beings, who cannot deliver!
[Ps 146:4] Their life’s breath departs, they return to the ground; on that day their plans die.

## Encouragement to Place Trust in God
¶[Ps 146:5] How blessed is the one whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God,
[Ps 146:6] the one who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who remains forever faithful,

## God's Care for the Vulnerable and Oppressed
¶[Ps 146:7] vindicates the oppressed, and gives food to the hungry. The Lord releases the imprisoned.
[Ps 146:8] The Lord gives sight to the blind. The Lord lifts up all who are bent over. The Lord loves the godly.
[Ps 146:9] The Lord protects the resident foreigner; he lifts up the fatherless and the widow, but he opposes the wicked.

## The Everlasting Reign of God
¶[Ps 146:10] The Lord rules forever, your God, O Zion, throughout the generations to come! Praise the Lord!
