# Psalms 38

## Introduction: Plea for Mercy
¶`Ps 38:1` A psalm of David, written to get God’s attention. O Lord, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger! Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury!
`Ps 38:2` For your arrows pierce me, and your hand presses me down.

## Personal Affliction: Description of Spiritual and Physical Suffering
¶`Ps 38:3` My whole body is sick because of your judgment; I am deprived of health because of my sin.
`Ps 38:4` For my sins overwhelm me; like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.
`Ps 38:5` My wounds are infected and starting to smell, because of my foolish sins.
`Ps 38:6` I am dazed and completely humiliated; all day long I walk around mourning.
`Ps 38:7` For I am overcome with shame and my whole body is sick.
`Ps 38:8` I am numb with pain and severely battered; I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.

## Personal Isolation: Rejection by Friends and Adversaries
¶`Ps 38:9` O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire; my groaning is not hidden from you.
`Ps 38:10` My heart beats quickly; my strength leaves me; I can hardly see.
`Ps 38:11` Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance; my neighbors stand far away.
`Ps 38:12` Those who seek my life try to entrap me; those who want to harm me speak destructive words; all day long they say deceitful things.

## Personal Response: Trust and Dependence on God
¶`Ps 38:13` But I am like a deaf man – I hear nothing; I am like a mute who cannot speak.
`Ps 38:14` I am like a man who cannot hear and is incapable of arguing his defense.
`Ps 38:15` Yet I wait for you, O Lord! You will respond, O Lord, my God!
`Ps 38:16` I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me; when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.

## Confession and Repentance: Acknowledgment of Sin
¶`Ps 38:17` For I am about to stumble, and I am in constant pain.
`Ps 38:18` Yes, I confess my wrongdoing, and I am concerned about my sins.
`Ps 38:19` But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous; those who hate me without cause outnumber me.
`Ps 38:20` They repay me evil for the good I have done; though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me.

## Conclusion: Plea for God's Help and Redemption
¶`Ps 38:21` Do not abandon me, O Lord! My God, do not remain far away from me!
`Ps 38:22` Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer!
