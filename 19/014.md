# Psalms 14

## Introduction: Declaration of Humanity's Corruption
¶[Ps 14:1] For the music director; by David. Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.” They sin and commit evil deeds; none of them does what is right.

## God's Examination of Humanity
¶[Ps 14:2] The Lord looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
[Ps 14:3] Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one!

## Iniquity of the Evildoers and Their Rejection
¶[Ps 14:4] All those who behave wickedly do not understand – those who devour my people as if they were eating bread, and do not call out to the Lord.
[Ps 14:5] They are absolutely terrified, for God defends the godly.
[Ps 14:6] You want to humiliate the oppressed, even though the Lord is their shelter.

## Anticipation of God's Salvation
¶[Ps 14:7] I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When the Lord restores the well-being of his people, may Jacob rejoice, may Israel be happy!
