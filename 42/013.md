# Luke 13

¶[Luke 13:1] Now there were some present on that occasion who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
[Luke 13:2] He answered them, “Do you think these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered these things?
[Luke 13:3] No, I tell you! But unless you repent, you will all perish as well!
[Luke 13:4] Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them, do you think they were worse offenders than all the others who live in Jerusalem?
[Luke 13:5] No, I tell you! But unless you repent you will all perish as well!”

¶[Luke 13:6] Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it and found none.
[Luke 13:7] So he said to the worker who tended the vineyard, ‘For three years now, I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and each time I inspect it I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue to deplete the soil?’
[Luke 13:8] But the worker answered him, ‘Sir, leave it alone this year too, until I dig around it and put fertilizer on it.
[Luke 13:9] Then if it bears fruit next year, very well, but if not, you can cut it down.’”

## Healing on the Sabbath
¶[Luke 13:10] Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,
[Luke 13:11] and a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten herself up completely.
[Luke 13:12] When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”
[Luke 13:13] Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
[Luke 13:14] But the president of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which work should be done! So come and be healed on those days, and not on the Sabbath day.”
[Luke 13:15] Then the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from its stall, and lead it to water?
[Luke 13:16] Then shouldn’t this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound for eighteen long years, be released from this imprisonment on the Sabbath day?”
[Luke 13:17] When he said this all his adversaries were humiliated, but the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things he was doing.

## The Kingdom of God and the narrow door
¶[Luke 13:18] Thus Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what should I compare it?
[Luke 13:19] It is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the wild birds nested in its branches.”

¶[Luke 13:20] Again he said, “To what should I compare the kingdom of God?
[Luke 13:21] It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all the dough had risen.”

¶[Luke 13:22] Then Jesus traveled throughout towns and villages, teaching and making his way toward Jerusalem.
[Luke 13:23] Someone asked him, “Lord, will only a few be saved?” So he said to them,
[Luke 13:24] “Exert every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.
[Luke 13:25] Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door, then you will stand outside and start to knock on the door and beg him, ‘Lord, let us in!’ But he will answer you, ‘I don’t know where you come from.’
[Luke 13:26] Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’
[Luke 13:27] But he will reply, ‘I don’t know where you come from! Go away from me, all you evildoers!’
[Luke 13:28] There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves thrown out.
[Luke 13:29] Then people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and take their places at the banquet table in the kingdom of God.
[Luke 13:30] But indeed, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”

## Jesus laments over Jerusalem
¶[Luke 13:31] At that time, some Pharisees came up and said to Jesus, “Get away from here, because Herod wants to kill you.”
[Luke 13:32] But he said to them, “Go and tell that fox, ‘Look, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will complete my work.
[Luke 13:33] Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the next day, because it is impossible that a prophet should be killed outside Jerusalem.’
[Luke 13:34] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would have none of it!
[Luke 13:35] Look, your house is forsaken! And I tell you, you will not see me until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’”
