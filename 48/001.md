# Galatians 1

## Opening Greeting
¶[Gal 1:1] From Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor by human agency, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead)
[Gal 1:2] and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia.

## Grace and Peace
¶[Gal 1:3] Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,
[Gal 1:4] who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,
[Gal 1:5] to whom be glory forever and ever! Amen.

## The Galatians' Desertion of the True Gospel
¶[Gal 1:6] I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are following a different gospel –
[Gal 1:7] not that there really is another gospel, but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ.
[Gal 1:8] But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be condemned to hell!
[Gal 1:9] As we have said before, and now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be condemned to hell!

## Paul's Calling and Independence
¶[Gal 1:10] Am I now trying to gain the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ!

¶[Gal 1:11] Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin.
[Gal 1:12] For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ.
[Gal 1:13] For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it.
[Gal 1:14] I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.
[Gal 1:15] But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased
[Gal 1:16] to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not go to ask advice from any human being,
[Gal 1:17] nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but right away I departed to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus.

## Paul's Visit to Jerusalem
¶[Gal 1:18] Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
[Gal 1:19] But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother.
[Gal 1:20] I assure you that, before God, I am not lying about what I am writing to you!
[Gal 1:21] Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
[Gal 1:22] But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
[Gal 1:23] They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”
[Gal 1:24] So they glorified God because of me.
