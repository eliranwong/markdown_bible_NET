[Ps 33:19] by saving their lives from death and sustaining them during times of famine.

# Psalms 36

## Introduction
¶[Ps 36:1] For the music director; written by the Lord’s servant, David; an oracle. An evil man is rebellious to the core. He does not fear God,

## Characteristics of the Unrighteous
¶[Ps 36:2] for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin.
[Ps 36:3] The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
[Ps 36:4] He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed; he is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is evil.

## Attributes of God
¶[Ps 36:5] O Lord, your loyal love reaches to the sky; your faithfulness to the clouds.
[Ps 36:6] Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you, Lord, preserve mankind and the animal kingdom.
[Ps 36:7] How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings.

[Ps 37:6] He will vindicate you in broad daylight, and publicly defend your just cause.

## The Inevitable End of the Wicked
¶[Ps 37:9] Wicked men will be wiped out, but those who rely on the Lord are the ones who will possess the land.
[Ps 37:10] Evil men will soon disappear; you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone.
[Ps 37:11] But the oppressed will possess the land and enjoy great prosperity.
[Ps 37:12] Evil men plot against the godly and viciously attack them.
[Ps 37:13] The Lord laughs in disgust at them, for he knows that their day is coming.
[Ps 37:14] Evil men draw their swords and prepare their bows, to bring down the oppressed and needy, and to slaughter those who are godly.
[Ps 37:15] Their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.

## The Blessings of the Righteous
¶[Ps 37:16] The little bit that a godly man owns is better than the wealth of many evil men,
[Ps 37:17] for evil men will lose their power, but the Lord sustains the godly.
[Ps 37:18] The Lord watches over the innocent day by day and they possess a permanent inheritance.
[Ps 37:19] They will not be ashamed when hard times come; when famine comes they will have enough to eat.
[Ps 37:20] But evil men will die; the Lord’s enemies will be incinerated – they will go up in smoke.
[Ps 37:21] Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt, but the godly show compassion and are generous.

[Ps 37:26] All day long he shows compassion and lends to others, and his children are blessed.
[Ps 37:27] Turn away from evil! Do what is right! Then you will enjoy lasting security.

[Ps 37:31] The law of their God controls their thinking; their feet do not slip.
[Ps 37:32] Evil men set an ambush for the godly and try to kill them.
[Ps 37:33] But the Lord does not surrender the godly, or allow them to be condemned in a court of law.

## The Final Comparison of the Wicked and Righteous
¶[Ps 37:34] Rely on the Lord! Obey his commands! Then he will permit you to possess the land; you will see the demise of evil men.
[Ps 37:35] I have seen ruthless evil men growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil.
[Ps 37:36] But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared! I looked for them, but they could not be found.
[Ps 37:37] Take note of the one who has integrity! Observe the upright! For the one who promotes peace has a future.
[Ps 37:38] Sinful rebels are totally destroyed; evil men have no future.
[Ps 37:39] But the Lord delivers the godly; he protects them in times of trouble.
[Ps 37:40] The Lord helps them and rescues them; he rescues them from evil men and delivers them, for they seek his protection.

[Ps 38:8] I am numb with pain and severely battered; I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.

## Personal Isolation: Rejection by Friends and Adversaries
¶[Ps 38:9] O Lord, you understand my heart’s desire; my groaning is not hidden from you.
[Ps 38:10] My heart beats quickly; my strength leaves me; I can hardly see.
[Ps 38:11] Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance; my neighbors stand far away.
[Ps 38:12] Those who seek my life try to entrap me; those who want to harm me speak destructive words; all day long they say deceitful things.

## Personal Response: Trust and Dependence on God
¶[Ps 38:13] But I am like a deaf man – I hear nothing; I am like a mute who cannot speak.
[Ps 38:14] I am like a man who cannot hear and is incapable of arguing his defense.
[Ps 38:15] Yet I wait for you, O Lord! You will respond, O Lord, my God!
[Ps 38:16] I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me; when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me.

## Conclusion: Plea for God's Help and Redemption
¶[Ps 38:21] Do not abandon me, O Lord! My God, do not remain far away from me!
[Ps 38:22] Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer!


# Psalms 39

## Introduction: Awareness of Frailty
¶[Ps 39:1] For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of David. I decided, “I will watch what I say and make sure I do not sin with my tongue. I will put a muzzle over my mouth while in the presence of an evil man.”
[Ps 39:2] I was stone silent; I held back the urge to speak. My frustration grew;
[Ps 39:3] my anxiety intensified. As I thought about it, I became impatient. Finally I spoke these words:

## Contemplating the Brevity of Life
¶[Ps 39:4] “O Lord, help me understand my mortality and the brevity of life! Let me realize how quickly my life will pass!
[Ps 39:5] Look, you make my days short-lived, and my life span is nothing from your perspective. Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor. (Selah)

[Ps 39:10] Please stop wounding me! You have almost beaten me to death!
[Ps 39:11] You severely discipline people for their sins; like a moth you slowly devour their strength. Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah)

## Closing Appeal: A Cry for Compassion
¶[Ps 39:12] Hear my prayer, O Lord! Listen to my cry for help! Do not ignore my sobbing! For I am a foreign resident with you, a temporary settler, just as all my ancestors were.
[Ps 39:13] Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy before I pass away.


# Psalms 40

## The Sacrifice of Obedience and Transformation
¶[Ps 40:6] Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern. You make that quite clear to me! You do not ask for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings.
[Ps 40:7] Then I say, “Look! I come! What is written in the scroll pertains to me.
[Ps 40:8] I want to do what pleases you, my God. Your law dominates my thoughts.”

## Supplication for God's Continued Help and Protection
¶[Ps 40:11] O Lord, you do not withhold your compassion from me. May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect me!
[Ps 40:12] For innumerable dangers surround me. My sins overtake me so I am unable to see; they outnumber the hairs of my head so my strength fails me.

## Praying for the Defeat of Evil Enemies
¶[Ps 40:13] Please be willing, O Lord, to rescue me! O Lord, hurry and help me!
[Ps 40:14] May those who are trying to snatch away my life be totally embarrassed and ashamed! May those who want to harm me be turned back and ashamed!

[Ps 41:8] They say, ‘An awful disease overwhelms him, and now that he is bed-ridden he will never recover.’
[Ps 41:9] Even my close friend whom I trusted, he who shared meals with me, has turned against me.
[Ps 41:10] As for you, O Lord, have mercy on me and raise me up, so I can pay them back!”

¶[Ps 41:11] By this I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.
[Ps 41:12] As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity; you allow me permanent access to your presence.

## Conclusion and Doxology
¶[Ps 41:13] The Lord God of Israel deserves praise in the future and forevermore! We agree! We agree!


# Psalms 42

## Longing for God in the Midst of Distress
¶[Ps 42:1] For the music director; a well-written song by the Korahites. As a deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, O God!
[Ps 42:2] I thirst for God, for the living God. I say, “When will I be able to go and appear in God’s presence?”
[Ps 42:3] I cannot eat, I weep day and night; all day long they say to me, “Where is your God?”
[Ps 42:4] I will remember and weep! For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God, shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.

## Hope in the Face of Despair
¶[Ps 42:5] Why are you depressed, O my soul? Why are you upset? Wait for God! For I will again give thanks to my God for his saving intervention.
[Ps 42:6] I am depressed, so I will pray to you while in the region of the upper Jordan, from Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
[Ps 42:7] One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls; all your billows and waves overwhelm me.
[Ps 42:8] By day the Lord decrees his loyal love, and by night he gives me a song, a prayer to the God of my life.

## Renewed Lament and Hope
¶[Ps 42:9] I will pray to God, my high ridge: “Why do you ignore me? Why must I walk around mourning because my enemies oppress me?”
[Ps 42:10] My enemies’ taunts cut into me to the bone, as they say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”

# Psalms 44

## Introduction: Confidence in God's Help
¶[Ps 44:1] For the music director; by the Korahites, a well-written song. O God, we have clearly heard; our ancestors have told us what you did in their days, in ancient times.
[Ps 44:2] You, by your power, defeated nations and settled our fathers on their land; you crushed the people living there and enabled our ancestors to occupy it.
[Ps 44:3] For they did not conquer the land by their swords, and they did not prevail by their strength, but rather by your power, strength and good favor, for you were partial to them.

## Faith Declared: Trust in God for Deliverance
¶[Ps 44:4] You are my king, O God! Decree Jacob’s deliverance!
[Ps 44:5] By your power we will drive back our enemies; by your strength we will trample down our foes!
[Ps 44:6] For I do not trust in my bow, and I do not prevail by my sword.
[Ps 44:7] For you deliver us from our enemies; you humiliate those who hate us.
[Ps 44:8] In God we boast all day long, and we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah)

## Lamentation: Suffering Despite Righteousness
¶[Ps 44:9] But you rejected and embarrassed us! You did not go into battle with our armies.
[Ps 44:10] You made us retreat from the enemy. Those who hate us take whatever they want from us.
[Ps 44:11] You handed us over like sheep to be eaten; you scattered us among the nations.
[Ps 44:12] You sold your people for a pittance; you did not ask a high price for them.
[Ps 44:13] You made us an object of disdain to our neighbors; those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
[Ps 44:14] You made us an object of ridicule among the nations; foreigners treat us with contempt.
[Ps 44:15] All day long I feel humiliated and am overwhelmed with shame,
[Ps 44:16] before the vindictive enemy who ridicules and insults me.

## Innocent Plea: Assertion of Loyalty to God
¶[Ps 44:17] All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you or violated your covenant with us.
[Ps 44:18] We have not been unfaithful, nor have we disobeyed your commands.
[Ps 44:19] Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs; you have covered us with darkness.
[Ps 44:20] If we had rejected our God, and spread out our hands in prayer to another god,
[Ps 44:21] would not God discover it, for he knows one’s thoughts?
[Ps 44:22] Yet because of you we are killed all day long; we are treated like sheep at the slaughtering block.

## Divine Intervention: A Call for God's Rescue
¶[Ps 44:23] Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Wake up! Do not reject us forever!
[Ps 44:24] Why do you look the other way, and ignore the way we are oppressed and mistreated?
[Ps 44:25] For we lie in the dirt, with our bellies pressed to the ground.
[Ps 44:26] Rise up and help us! Rescue us because of your loyal love!


# Psalms 45

## Introduction: Praise to the King

## The Bride's Call to Loyalty and submission

[Ps 45:11] Then the king will be attracted by your beauty. After all, he is your master! Submit to him!

[Ps 48:2] It is lofty and pleasing to look at, a source of joy to the whole earth. Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon; it is the city of the great king.
[Ps 48:3] God is in its fortresses; he reveals himself as its defender.

## The Lord's Defense of Zion
¶[Ps 48:4] For look, the kings assemble; they advance together.
[Ps 48:5] As soon as they see, they are shocked; they are terrified, they quickly retreat.

## The Challenge of Wealth and Mortality
¶[Ps 49:5] Why should I be afraid in times of trouble, when the sinful deeds of deceptive men threaten to overwhelm me?
[Ps 49:6] They trust in their wealth and boast in their great riches.
[Ps 49:7] Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother; he cannot pay God an adequate ransom price
[Ps 49:8] (the ransom price for a human life is too high, and people go to their final destiny),
[Ps 49:9] so that he might continue to live forever and not experience death.
[Ps 49:10] Surely one sees that even wise people die; fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away and leave their wealth to others.
[Ps 49:11] Their grave becomes their permanent residence, their eternal dwelling place. They name their lands after themselves,
[Ps 49:12] but, despite their wealth, people do not last, they are like animals that perish.

[Ps 49:15] But God will rescue my life from the power of Sheol; certainly he will pull me to safety. (Selah)
[Ps 49:16] Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich and his wealth multiplies!
[Ps 49:17] For he will take nothing with him when he dies; his wealth will not follow him down into the grave.
[Ps 49:18] He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive: “May men praise you, for you have done well!”
[Ps 49:19] But he will join his ancestors; they will never again see the light of day.
[Ps 49:20] Wealthy people do not understand; they are like animals that perish.


# Psalms 50

## Introduction: God's Call to Worship
¶[Ps 50:1] A psalm by Asaph. El, God, the Lord has spoken, and summoned the earth to come from the east and west.
[Ps 50:2] From Zion, the most beautiful of all places, God has come in splendor.
[Ps 50:3] “May our God come and not be silent.” Consuming fire goes ahead of him and all around him a storm rages.
[Ps 50:4] He summons the heavens above, as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people.
[Ps 50:5] He says: “Assemble my covenant people before me, those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice!”

[Ps 50:8] I am not condemning you because of your sacrifices, or because of your burnt sacrifices that you continually offer me.
[Ps 50:9] I do not need to take a bull from your household or goats from your sheepfolds.
[Ps 50:10] For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me, as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills.
[Ps 50:11] I keep track of every bird in the hills, and the insects of the field are mine.
[Ps 50:12] Even if I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and all it contains belong to me.
[Ps 50:13] Do I eat the flesh of bulls? Do I drink the blood of goats?
[Ps 50:14] Present to God a thank-offering! Repay your vows to the Most High!
[Ps 50:15] Pray to me when you are in trouble! I will deliver you, and you will honor me!”

## The Wicked and their deeds
¶[Ps 50:16] God says this to the evildoer: “How can you declare my commands, and talk about my covenant?
[Ps 50:17] For you hate instruction and reject my words.
[Ps 50:18] When you see a thief, you join him; you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives.
[Ps 50:19] You do damage with words, and use your tongue to deceive.
[Ps 50:20] You plot against your brother; you slander your own brother.

## God's Warning and Final Judgment
¶[Ps 50:21] When you did these things, I was silent, so you thought I was exactly like you. But now I will condemn you and state my case against you!
[Ps 50:22] Carefully consider this, you who reject God! Otherwise I will rip you to shreds and no one will be able to rescue you.
[Ps 50:23] Whoever presents a thank-offering honors me. To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to deliver.”


# Psalms 51

[Ps 51:2] Wash away my wrongdoing! Cleanse me of my sin!

## Acknowledgment of Sin and Guilt
¶[Ps 51:3] For I am aware of my rebellious acts; I am forever conscious of my sin.
[Ps 51:4] Against you – you above all – I have sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. So you are just when you confront me; you are right when you condemn me.
[Ps 51:5] Look, I was guilty of sin from birth, a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
[Ps 51:6] Look, you desire integrity in the inner man; you want me to possess wisdom.

## Prayer for Renewal and Restoration
¶[Ps 51:7] Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be pure; wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
[Ps 51:8] Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven! May the bones you crushed rejoice!

[Ps 51:14] Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me! Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your righteousness.
[Ps 51:15] O Lord, give me the words! Then my mouth will praise you.

## True Repentance and Sacrifice
¶[Ps 51:16] Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it; you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.
[Ps 51:17] The sacrifices God desires are a humble spirit – O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.

## Petition for Favor and Prosperity of Zion
¶[Ps 51:18] Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her! Fortify the walls of Jerusalem!
[Ps 51:19] Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings; then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.


# Psalms 52

## The Arrogance of the Wicked
¶[Ps 52:1] For the music director; a well-written song by David. It was written when Doeg the Edomite went and informed Saul: “David has arrived at the home of Ahimelech.” Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man? God’s loyal love protects me all day long!
[Ps 52:2] Your tongue carries out your destructive plans; it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.
[Ps 52:3] You love evil more than good, lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)

## God's Response to the Wicked
¶[Ps 52:4] You love to use all the words that destroy, and the tongue that deceives.
[Ps 52:5] Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins. He will scoop you up and remove you from your home; he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)

## Righteous Spectators
¶[Ps 52:6] When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe, and will mock the evildoer, saying:
[Ps 52:7] “Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector! He trusted in his great wealth and was confident about his plans to destroy others.”

## The Faith of the Righteous
¶[Ps 52:8] But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I continually trust in God’s loyal love.
[Ps 52:9] I will continually thank you when you execute judgment; I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you are good.


# Psalms 53

## Introduction: The Foolishness of Denying God
¶[Ps 53:1] For the music director; according to the machalath style; a well-written song by David. Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.” They sin and commit evil deeds; none of them does what is right.

## The Depravity of Humanity
¶[Ps 53:2] God looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
[Ps 53:3] Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one!

## The Consequences of Sin
¶[Ps 53:4] All those who behave wickedly do not understand – those who devour my people as if they were eating bread, and do not call out to God.
[Ps 53:5] They are absolutely terrified, even by things that do not normally cause fear. For God annihilates those who attack you. You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.

## The Cry for Salvation
¶[Ps 53:6] I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the well-being of his people, may Jacob rejoice, may Israel be happy!

¶[Ps 54:3] For foreigners attack me; ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah)

## Confidence in God's Support and Vindication
¶[Ps 54:4] Look, God is my deliverer! The Lord is among those who support me.
[Ps 54:5] May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil! As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them!

## Expression of Gratitude for God's Deliverance
¶[Ps 54:6] With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you! I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good!
[Ps 54:7] Surely he rescues me from all trouble, and I triumph over my enemies.


# Psalms 55

## Introduction: A Cry for Help
¶[Ps 55:1] For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a well-written song by David. Listen, O God, to my prayer! Do not ignore my appeal for mercy!
[Ps 55:2] Pay attention to me and answer me! I am so upset and distressed, I am beside myself,
[Ps 55:3] because of what the enemy says, and because of how the wicked pressure me, for they hurl trouble down upon me and angrily attack me.

## The Betrayal by a Trusted Friend
¶[Ps 55:4] My heart beats violently within me; the horrors of death overcome me.
[Ps 55:5] Fear and panic overpower me; terror overwhelms me.
[Ps 55:6] I say, “I wish I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and settle in a safe place!
[Ps 55:7] Look, I will escape to a distant place; I will stay in the wilderness. (Selah)
[Ps 55:8] I will hurry off to a place that is safe from the strong wind and the gale.”

## The Corruption and Deceit in the City
¶[Ps 55:9] Confuse them, O Lord! Frustrate their plans! For I see violence and conflict in the city.
[Ps 55:10] Day and night they walk around on its walls, while wickedness and destruction are within it.
[Ps 55:11] Disaster is within it; violence and deceit do not depart from its public square.

## The Broken Bond of Friendship
¶[Ps 55:12] Indeed, it is not an enemy who insults me, or else I could bear it; it is not one who hates me who arrogantly taunts me, or else I could hide from him.
[Ps 55:13] But it is you, a man like me, my close friend in whom I confided.
[Ps 55:14] We would share personal thoughts with each other; in God’s temple we would walk together among the crowd.
[Ps 55:15] May death destroy them! May they go down alive into Sheol! For evil is in their dwelling place and in their midst.

## Assurance in God's Help
¶[Ps 55:16] As for me, I will call out to God, and the Lord will deliver me.
[Ps 55:17] During the evening, morning, and noontime I will lament and moan, and he will hear me.
[Ps 55:18] He will rescue me and protect me from those who attack me, even though they greatly outnumber me.
[Ps 55:19] God, the one who has reigned as king from long ago, will hear and humiliate them. (Selah) They refuse to change, and do not fear God.

## The False Friend's Fate and the Faithful's Resolution
¶[Ps 55:20] He attacks his friends; he breaks his solemn promises to them.
[Ps 55:21] His words are as smooth as butter, but he harbors animosity in his heart. His words seem softer than oil, but they are really like sharp swords.
[Ps 55:22] Throw your burden upon the Lord, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the godly to be shaken.
[Ps 55:23] But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit. Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a normal lifespan. But as for me, I trust in you.


# Psalms 56

## Trust in God Amidst Persecution
¶[Ps 56:1] For the music director; according to the yonath-elem-rekhoqim style; a prayer of David, written when the Philistines captured him in Gath. Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me! All day long hostile enemies are tormenting me.
[Ps 56:2] Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long. Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One.

## Keeping Faith in God's Protection
¶[Ps 56:3] When I am afraid, I trust in you.
[Ps 56:4] In God – I boast in his promise – in God I trust, I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me?

## The Continuous Plots of Oppressors
¶[Ps 56:5] All day long they cause me trouble; they make a habit of plotting my demise.
[Ps 56:6] They stalk and lurk; they watch my every step, as they prepare to take my life.
[Ps 56:7] Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape! In your anger bring down the nations, O God!

## Acknowledgment of God's Sovereignty
¶[Ps 56:8] You keep track of my misery. Put my tears in your leather container! Are they not recorded in your scroll?
[Ps 56:9] My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help; I know that God is on my side.

## Rejoicing in God's Deliverance
¶[Ps 56:10] In God – I boast in his promise – in the Lord – I boast in his promise –
[Ps 56:11] in God I trust, I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me?

¶[Ps 56:12] I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God; I will give you the thank-offerings you deserve,
[Ps 56:13] when you deliver my life from death. You keep my feet from stumbling, so that I might serve God as I enjoy life.

## Personal Distress amidst Adversaries
¶[Ps 57:3] May he send help from heaven and deliver me from my enemies who hurl insults! (Selah) May God send his loyal love and faithfulness!
[Ps 57:4] I am surrounded by lions; I lie down among those who want to devour me; men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are a sharp sword.

## Confidence in God's Exaltation
¶[Ps 57:5] Rise up above the sky, O God! May your splendor cover the whole earth!
[Ps 57:6] They have prepared a net to trap me; I am discouraged. They have dug a pit for me. They will fall into it! (Selah)

## Commitment to Praise and Worship
¶[Ps 57:7] I am determined, O God! I am determined! I will sing and praise you!

## Introduction
¶[Ps 58:1] For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David. Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions? Do you judge people fairly?
[Ps 58:2] No! You plan how to do what is unjust; you deal out violence in the earth.

## Evils of the Wicked
¶[Ps 58:3] The wicked turn aside from birth; liars go astray as soon as they are born.
[Ps 58:4] Their venom is like that of a snake, like a deaf serpent that does not hear,
[Ps 58:5] that does not respond to the magicians, or to a skilled snake charmer.

## Judgment Against the Wicked
¶[Ps 58:6] O God, break the teeth in their mouths! Smash the jawbones of the lions, O Lord!
[Ps 58:7] Let them disappear like water that flows away! Let them wither like grass!
[Ps 58:8] Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves along! Let them be like stillborn babies that never see the sun!
[Ps 58:9] Before the kindling is even placed under your pots, he will sweep it away along with both the raw and cooked meat.

## Righteousness Triumphs
¶[Ps 58:10] The godly will rejoice when they see vengeance carried out; they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.

[Ps 59:7] Look, they hurl insults at me and openly threaten to kill me, for they say, “Who hears?”

## Confidence in God as a Stronghold
¶[Ps 59:8] But you, O Lord, laugh in disgust at them; you taunt all the nations.
[Ps 59:9] You are my source of strength! I will wait for you! For God is my refuge.
[Ps 59:10] The God who loves me will help me; God will enable me to triumph over my enemies.

## The Desire for Deferred Judgment
¶[Ps 59:11] Do not strike them dead suddenly, because then my people might forget the lesson. Use your power to make them homeless vagabonds and then bring them down, O Lord who shields us!
[Ps 59:12] They speak sinful words. So let them be trapped by their own pride and by the curses and lies they speak!
[Ps 59:13] Angrily wipe them out! Wipe them out so they vanish! Let them know that God rules in Jacob and to the ends of the earth! (Selah)

## A Song of Praise
¶[Ps 59:14] They return in the evening; they growl like a dog and prowl around outside the city.
[Ps 59:15] They wander around looking for something to eat; they refuse to sleep until they are full.

## Trust and Exaltation of the Lord
¶[Ps 59:16] As for me, I will sing about your strength; I will praise your loyal love in the morning. For you are my refuge and my place of shelter when I face trouble.

## Confident Appeal for God's Presence and Assistance
¶[Ps 60:9] Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom?
[Ps 60:10] Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.
[Ps 60:11] Give us help against the enemy, for any help men might offer is futile.
[Ps 60:12] By God’s power we will conquer; he will trample down our enemies.

# Psalms 69

## The Psalmist's Cry for Help
¶[Ps 69:1] For the music director; according to the tune of “Lilies;” by David. Deliver me, O God, for the water has reached my neck.
[Ps 69:2] I sink into the deep mire where there is no solid ground; I am in deep water, and the current overpowers me.
[Ps 69:3] I am exhausted from shouting for help; my throat is sore; my eyes grow tired of looking for my God.
[Ps 69:4] Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head. Those who want to destroy me, my enemies for no reason, outnumber me. They make me repay what I did not steal!

## The Psalmist's Confession and Appeal
¶[Ps 69:5] O God, you are aware of my foolish sins; my guilt is not hidden from you.
[Ps 69:6] Let none who rely on you be disgraced because of me, O Sovereign Lord of Heaven’s Armies! Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me, O God of Israel!
[Ps 69:7] For I suffer humiliation for your sake and am thoroughly disgraced.
[Ps 69:8] My own brothers treat me like a stranger; they act as if I were a foreigner.
[Ps 69:9] Certainly zeal for your house consumes me; I endure the insults of those who insult you.
[Ps 69:10] I weep and refrain from eating food, which causes others to insult me.
[Ps 69:11] I wear sackcloth and they ridicule me.
[Ps 69:12] Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me; drunkards mock me in their songs.

## The Psalmist's Prayer for Deliverance
¶[Ps 69:13] O Lord, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me! O God, because of your great loyal love, answer me with your faithful deliverance!
[Ps 69:14] Rescue me from the mud! Don’t let me sink! Deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep water!
[Ps 69:15] Don’t let the current overpower me! Don’t let the deep swallow me up! Don’t let the Pit devour me!
[Ps 69:16] Answer me, O Lord, for your loyal love is good! Because of your great compassion, turn toward me!
[Ps 69:17] Do not ignore your servant, for I am in trouble! Answer me right away!
[Ps 69:18] Come near me and redeem me! Because of my enemies, rescue me!

## The Psalmist's Plea for Divine Judgment
¶[Ps 69:19] You know how I am insulted, humiliated and disgraced; you can see all my enemies.
[Ps 69:20] Their insults are painful and make me lose heart; I look for sympathy, but receive none, for comforters, but find none.
[Ps 69:21] They put bitter poison into my food, and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
[Ps 69:22] May their dining table become a trap before them! May it be a snare for that group of friends!
[Ps 69:23] May their eyes be blinded! Make them shake violently!
[Ps 69:24] Pour out your judgment on them! May your raging anger overtake them!
[Ps 69:25] May their camp become desolate, their tents uninhabited!
[Ps 69:26] For they harass the one whom you discipline; they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish.
[Ps 69:27] Hold them accountable for all their sins! Do not vindicate them!
[Ps 69:28] May their names be deleted from the scroll of the living! Do not let their names be listed with the godly!

## The Psalmist's Praise and Vow
¶[Ps 69:29] I am oppressed and suffering! O God, deliver and protect me!
[Ps 69:30] I will sing praises to God’s name! I will magnify him as I give him thanks!
[Ps 69:31] That will please the Lord more than an ox or a bull with horns and hooves.
[Ps 69:32] The oppressed look on – let them rejoice! You who seek God, may you be encouraged!
[Ps 69:33] For the Lord listens to the needy; he does not despise his captive people.
[Ps 69:34] Let the heavens and the earth praise him, along with the seas and everything that swims in them!
[Ps 69:35] For God will deliver Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, and his people will again live in them and possess Zion.
[Ps 69:36] The descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who are loyal to him will live in it.

# Psalms 73

## Introduction: The Psalmist's Struggle
¶[Ps 73:1] A psalm by Asaph. Certainly God is good to Israel, and to those whose motives are pure!
[Ps 73:2] But as for me, my feet almost slipped; my feet almost slid out from under me.
[Ps 73:3] For I envied those who are proud, as I observed the prosperity of the wicked.

## Description of the Wicked's Prosperity
¶[Ps 73:4] For they suffer no pain; their bodies are strong and well-fed.
[Ps 73:5] They are immune to the trouble common to men; they do not suffer as other men do.
[Ps 73:6] Arrogance is their necklace, and violence covers them like clothing.
[Ps 73:7] Their prosperity causes them to do wrong; their thoughts are sinful.
[Ps 73:8] They mock and say evil things; they proudly threaten violence.
[Ps 73:9] They speak as if they rule in heaven, and lay claim to the earth.
[Ps 73:10] Therefore they have more than enough food to eat, and even suck up the water of the sea.
[Ps 73:11] They say, “How does God know what we do? Is the Most High aware of what goes on?”
[Ps 73:12] Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like, those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.

## The Psalmist's Internal Struggle
¶[Ps 73:13] I concluded, “Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure and maintained a pure lifestyle.
[Ps 73:14] I suffer all day long, and am punished every morning.”
[Ps 73:15] If I had publicized these thoughts, I would have betrayed your people.
[Ps 73:16] When I tried to make sense of this, it was troubling to me.

## The Turning Point: Reflecting in God's Sanctuary
¶[Ps 73:17] Then I entered the precincts of God’s temple, and understood the destiny of the wicked.
[Ps 73:18] Surely you put them in slippery places; you bring them down to ruin.
[Ps 73:19] How desolate they become in a mere moment! Terrifying judgments make their demise complete!
[Ps 73:20] They are like a dream after one wakes up. O Lord, when you awake you will despise them.

## The Psalmist's Repentance and Renewed Relationship with God
¶[Ps 73:21] Yes, my spirit was bitter, and my insides felt sharp pain.
[Ps 73:22] I was ignorant and lacked insight; I was as senseless as an animal before you.
[Ps 73:23] But I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
[Ps 73:24] You guide me by your wise advice, and then you will lead me to a position of honor.
[Ps 73:25] Whom do I have in heaven but you? I desire no one but you on earth.
[Ps 73:26] My flesh and my heart may grow weak, but God always protects my heart and gives me stability.

## Conclusion: Praising God and Declaring His Deeds
¶[Ps 73:27] Yes, look! Those far from you die; you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
[Ps 73:28] But as for me, God’s presence is all I need. I have made the Sovereign Lord my shelter, as I declare all the things you have done.

¶[Ps 74:1] A well-written song by Asaph. Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us? Why does your anger burn against the sheep of your pasture?
[Ps 74:2] Remember your people whom you acquired in ancient times, whom you rescued so they could be your very own nation, as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell!
[Ps 74:3] Hurry to the permanent ruins, and to all the damage the enemy has done to the temple!

## The Destruction of the Sanctuary
¶[Ps 74:4] Your enemies roar in the middle of your sanctuary; they set up their battle flags.
[Ps 74:5] They invade like lumberjacks swinging their axes in a thick forest.
[Ps 74:6] And now they are tearing down all its engravings with axes and crowbars.
[Ps 74:7] They set your sanctuary on fire; they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.
[Ps 74:8] They say to themselves, “We will oppress all of them.” They burn down all the places where people worship God in the land.

## The Lament over God's Absence
¶[Ps 74:9] We do not see any signs of God’s presence; there are no longer any prophets and we have no one to tell us how long this will last.
[Ps 74:10] How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults? Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
[Ps 74:11] Why do you remain inactive? Intervene and destroy him!

## The Affirmation of God's Mighty Deeds
¶[Ps 74:12] But God has been my king from ancient times, performing acts of deliverance on the earth.
[Ps 74:13] You destroyed the sea by your strength; you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water.
[Ps 74:14] You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you fed him to the people who live along the coast.
[Ps 74:15] You broke open the spring and the stream; you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.
[Ps 74:16] You established the cycle of day and night; you put the moon and sun in place.
[Ps 74:17] You set up all the boundaries of the earth; you created the cycle of summer and winter.

## The Plea for God's Intervention
¶[Ps 74:18] Remember how the enemy hurls insults, O Lord, and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name!
[Ps 74:19] Do not hand the life of your dove over to a wild animal! Do not continue to disregard the lives of your oppressed people!
[Ps 74:20] Remember your covenant promises, for the dark regions of the earth are full of places where violence rules.
[Ps 74:21] Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame! Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!
[Ps 74:22] Rise up, O God! Defend your honor! Remember how fools insult you all day long!
[Ps 74:23] Do not disregard what your enemies say, or the unceasing shouts of those who defy you.


# Psalms 75

## Introduction: Gratitude for God's Wondrous Deeds
¶[Ps 75:1] For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a psalm of Asaph; a song. We give thanks to you, O God! We give thanks! You reveal your presence; people tell about your amazing deeds.
[Ps 75:2] God says, “At the appointed times, I judge fairly.
[Ps 75:3] When the earth and all its inhabitants dissolve in fear, I make its pillars secure.” (Selah)

## Warning Against Boasting and Arrogance
¶[Ps 75:4] I say to the proud, “Do not be proud,” and to the wicked, “Do not be so confident of victory!
[Ps 75:5] Do not be so certain you have won! Do not speak with your head held so high!
[Ps 75:6] For victory does not come from the east or west, or from the wilderness.
[Ps 75:7] For God is the judge! He brings one down and exalts another.
[Ps 75:8] For the Lord holds in his hand a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices, and pours it out. Surely all the wicked of the earth will slurp it up and drink it to its very last drop.”

## Resolute Praise and Commitment
¶[Ps 75:9] As for me, I will continually tell what you have done; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob!
[Ps 75:10] God says, “I will bring down all the power of the wicked; the godly will be victorious.”


# Psalms 76

## Introduction: God's Mighty Presence
¶[Ps 76:1] For the music director; to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song. God has revealed himself in Judah; in Israel his reputation is great.
[Ps 76:2] He lives in Salem; he dwells in Zion.
[Ps 76:3] There he shattered the arrows, the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)

## God's Powerful Judgment
¶[Ps 76:4] You shine brightly and reveal your majesty, as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.
[Ps 76:5] The bravehearted were plundered; they “fell asleep.” All the warriors were helpless.
[Ps 76:6] At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse “fell asleep.”

## God's Overwhelming Sovereignty
¶[Ps 76:7] You are awesome! Yes, you! Who can withstand your intense anger?
[Ps 76:8] From heaven you announced what their punishment would be. The earth was afraid and silent
[Ps 76:9] when God arose to execute judgment, and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
[Ps 76:10] Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise; you reveal your anger in full measure.

## Giving Praise and Glory to God
¶[Ps 76:11] Make vows to the Lord your God and repay them! Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!
[Ps 76:12] He humbles princes; the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.


# Psalms 77

## Introduction: Cry for Help
¶[Ps 77:1] For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of Asaph. I will cry out to God and call for help! I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me.
[Ps 77:2] In my time of trouble I sought the Lord. I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night. I refused to be comforted.

## Reflections on Sleepless Nights
¶[Ps 77:3] I said, “I will remember God while I groan; I will think about him while my strength leaves me.” (Selah)
[Ps 77:4] You held my eyelids open; I was troubled and could not speak.
[Ps 77:5] I thought about the days of old, about ancient times.
[Ps 77:6] I said, “During the night I will remember the song I once sang; I will think very carefully.” I tried to make sense of what was happening.

## Recalling God's Past Faithfulness
¶[Ps 77:7] I asked, “Will the Lord reject me forever? Will he never again show me his favor?
[Ps 77:8] Has his loyal love disappeared forever? Has his promise failed forever?
[Ps 77:9] Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has his anger stifled his compassion?” (Selah)
[Ps 77:10] Then I said, “I am sickened by the thought that the Most High might become inactive.

## Meditations on God's Wondrous Works
¶[Ps 77:11] I will remember the works of the Lord. Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago!
[Ps 77:12] I will think about all you have done; I will reflect upon your deeds!”

## God's Control Over Nature
¶[Ps 77:13] O God, your deeds are extraordinary! What god can compare to our great God?
[Ps 77:14] You are the God who does amazing things; you have revealed your strength among the nations.
[Ps 77:15] You delivered your people by your strength – the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)

## God's Power Displayed in the Miracle at the Red Sea
¶[Ps 77:16] The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and trembled. Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear.
[Ps 77:17] The clouds poured down rain; the skies thundered. Yes, your arrows flashed about.
[Ps 77:18] Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind; the lightning bolts lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
[Ps 77:19] You walked through the sea; you passed through the surging waters, but left no footprints.
[Ps 77:20] You led your people like a flock of sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.


# Psalms 78

## Introduction: The Purpose of the Psalm and Importance of Remembering God's Works
¶[Ps 78:1] A well-written song by Asaph. Pay attention, my people, to my instruction! Listen to the words I speak!
[Ps 78:2] I will sing a song that imparts wisdom; I will make insightful observations about the past.
[Ps 78:3] What we have heard and learned – that which our ancestors have told us –
[Ps 78:4] we will not hide from their descendants. We will tell the next generation about the Lord’s praiseworthy acts, about his strength and the amazing things he has done.
[Ps 78:5] He established a rule in Jacob; he set up a law in Israel. He commanded our ancestors to make his deeds known to their descendants,
[Ps 78:6] so that the next generation, children yet to be born, might know about them. They will grow up and tell their descendants about them.
[Ps 78:7] Then they will place their confidence in God. They will not forget the works of God, and they will obey his commands.
[Ps 78:8] Then they will not be like their ancestors, who were a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that was not committed and faithful to God.

## Israel's History of Rebellion and Unfaithfulness
¶[Ps 78:9] The Ephraimites were armed with bows, but they retreated in the day of battle.
[Ps 78:10] They did not keep their covenant with God, and they refused to obey his law.
[Ps 78:11] They forgot what he had done, the amazing things he had shown them.
[Ps 78:12] He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors, in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
[Ps 78:13] He divided the sea and led them across it; he made the water stand in a heap.
[Ps 78:14] He led them with a cloud by day, and with the light of a fire all night long.
[Ps 78:15] He broke open rocks in the wilderness, and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea.
[Ps 78:16] He caused streams to flow from the rock, and made the water flow like rivers.

¶[Ps 78:17] Yet they continued to sin against him, and rebelled against the Most High in the desert.
[Ps 78:18] They willfully challenged God by asking for food to satisfy their appetite.
[Ps 78:19] They insulted God, saying, “Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness?
[Ps 78:20] Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out, streams gushed forth. But can he also give us food? Will he provide meat for his people?”
[Ps 78:21] When the Lord heard this, he was furious. A fire broke out against Jacob, and his anger flared up against Israel,
[Ps 78:22] because they did not have faith in God, and did not trust his ability to deliver them.
[Ps 78:23] He gave a command to the clouds above, and opened the doors in the sky.
[Ps 78:24] He rained down manna for them to eat; he gave them the grain of heaven.
[Ps 78:25] Man ate the food of the mighty ones. He sent them more than enough to eat.
[Ps 78:26] He brought the east wind through the sky, and by his strength led forth the south wind.
[Ps 78:27] He rained down meat on them like dust, birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores.
[Ps 78:28] He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp, all around their homes.
[Ps 78:29] They ate until they were beyond full; he gave them what they desired.
[Ps 78:30] They were not yet filled up, their food was still in their mouths,
[Ps 78:31] when the anger of God flared up against them. He killed some of the strongest of them; he brought the young men of Israel to their knees.

¶[Ps 78:32] Despite all this, they continued to sin, and did not trust him to do amazing things.
[Ps 78:33] So he caused them to die unsatisfied and filled with terror.
[Ps 78:34] When he struck them down, they sought his favor; they turned back and longed for God.
[Ps 78:35] They remembered that God was their protector, and that God Most High was their deliverer.
[Ps 78:36] But they deceived him with their words, and lied to him.
[Ps 78:37] They were not really committed to him, and they were unfaithful to his covenant.
[Ps 78:38] Yet he is compassionate. He forgives sin and does not destroy. He often holds back his anger, and does not stir up his fury.
[Ps 78:39] He remembered that they were made of flesh, and were like a wind that blows past and does not return.

¶[Ps 78:40] How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and insulted him in the wastelands!
[Ps 78:41] They again challenged God, and offended the Holy One of Israel.

## God's Deliverance of Israel from Egypt and Demonstrations of Power
¶[Ps 78:42] They did not remember what he had done, how he delivered them from the enemy,
[Ps 78:43] when he performed his awesome deeds in Egypt, and his acts of judgment in the region of Zoan.
[Ps 78:44] He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams.
[Ps 78:45] He sent swarms of biting insects against them, as well as frogs that overran their land.
[Ps 78:46] He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust.
[Ps 78:47] He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with driving rain.
[Ps 78:48] He rained hail down on their cattle, and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock.
[Ps 78:49] His raging anger lashed out against them, He sent fury, rage, and trouble as messengers who bring disaster.
[Ps 78:50] He sent his anger in full force; he did not spare them from death; he handed their lives over to destruction.
[Ps 78:51] He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their reproductive power in the tents of Ham.
[Ps 78:52] Yet he brought out his people like sheep; he led them through the wilderness like a flock.
[Ps 78:53] He guided them safely along, and they were not afraid; but the sea covered their enemies.
[Ps 78:54] He brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountainous land which his right hand acquired.
[Ps 78:55] He drove the nations out from before them; he assigned them their tribal allotments and allowed the tribes of Israel to settle down.

## Israel's Continued Rebellion, Idolatry, and Punishment
¶[Ps 78:56] Yet they challenged and defied God Most High, and did not obey his commands.
[Ps 78:57] They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors; they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow.
[Ps 78:58] They made him angry with their pagan shrines, and made him jealous with their idols.
[Ps 78:59] God heard and was angry; he completely rejected Israel.
[Ps 78:60] He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh, the tent where he lived among men.
[Ps 78:61] He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured; he gave the symbol of his splendor into the hand of the enemy.
[Ps 78:62] He delivered his people over to the sword, and was angry with his chosen nation.
[Ps 78:63] Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins remained unmarried.
[Ps 78:64] Their priests fell by the sword, but their widows did not weep.

¶[Ps 78:65] But then the Lord awoke from his sleep; he was like a warrior in a drunken rage.
[Ps 78:66] He drove his enemies back; he made them a permanent target for insults.
[Ps 78:67] He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
[Ps 78:68] He chose the tribe of Judah, and Mount Zion, which he loves.
[Ps 78:69] He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above; as secure as the earth, which he established permanently.
[Ps 78:70] He chose David, his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.
[Ps 78:71] He took him away from following the mother sheep, and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and of Israel, his chosen nation.
[Ps 78:72] David cared for them with pure motives; he led them with skill.

## Lament over the destruction of Jerusalem
¶[Ps 79:2] They have given the corpses of your servants to the birds of the sky; the flesh of your loyal followers to the beasts of the earth.
[Ps 79:3] They have made their blood flow like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury them.
[Ps 79:4] We have become an object of disdain to our neighbors; those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.

## Prayer for justice and retribution

[Ps 79:12] Pay back our neighbors in full! May they be insulted the same way they insulted you, O Lord!

## The Vineyard Parable and Israel's History
¶[Ps 80:8] You uprooted a vine from Egypt; you drove out nations and transplanted it.
[Ps 80:9] You cleared the ground for it; it took root, and filled the land.
[Ps 80:10] The mountains were covered by its shadow, the highest cedars by its branches.
[Ps 80:11] Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea, and its shoots the Euphrates River.
[Ps 80:12] Why did you break down its walls, so that all who pass by pluck its fruit?
[Ps 80:13] The wild boars of the forest ruin it; the insects of the field feed on it.
[Ps 80:14] O God of Heaven’s Armies, come back! Look down from heaven and take notice! Take care of this vine,
[Ps 80:15] the root your right hand planted, the shoot you made to grow!
[Ps 80:16] It is burned and cut down. They die because you are displeased with them.

## The Hope for Restoration

[Ps 81:3] Sound the ram’s horn on the day of the new moon, and on the day of the full moon when our festival begins.

## The Reason for Praise: God's Deliverance of Israel
¶[Ps 81:4] For observing the festival is a requirement for Israel; it is an ordinance given by the God of Jacob.

[Ps 81:6] It said: “I removed the burden from his shoulder; his hands were released from holding the basket.

[Ps 82:3] Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless! Vindicate the oppressed and suffering!
[Ps 82:4] Rescue the poor and needy! Deliver them from the power of the wicked!

## Consequences of the Rulers' Failure
¶[Ps 82:5] They neither know nor understand. They stumble around in the dark, while all the foundations of the earth crumble.

## The Unholy Alliance against God's People
¶[Ps 83:3] They carefully plot against your people, and make plans to harm the ones you cherish.
[Ps 83:4] They say, “Come on, let’s annihilate them so they are no longer a nation! Then the name of Israel will be remembered no more.”
[Ps 83:5] Yes, they devise a unified strategy; they form an alliance against you.
[Ps 83:6] It includes the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
[Ps 83:7] Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre.
[Ps 83:8] Even Assyria has allied with them, lending its strength to the descendants of Lot. (Selah)

## Historical Examples of Divine Judgment
¶[Ps 83:9] Do to them as you did to Midian – as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River!
[Ps 83:10] They were destroyed at En Dor; their corpses were like manure on the ground.
[Ps 83:11] Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna,
[Ps 83:12] who said, “Let’s take over the pastures of God!”

## The Prayer for Vengeance and Confusion
¶[Ps 83:13] O my God, make them like dead thistles, like dead weeds blown away by the wind!
[Ps 83:14] Like the fire that burns down the forest, or the flames that consume the mountainsides,
[Ps 83:15] chase them with your gale winds, and terrify them with your windstorm.
[Ps 83:16] Cover their faces with shame, so they might seek you, O Lord.
[Ps 83:17] May they be humiliated and continually terrified! May they die in shame!

## Trusting in God's Protection and Blessings
¶[Ps 84:9] O God, take notice of our shield! Show concern for your chosen king!
[Ps 84:10] Certainly spending just one day in your temple courts is better than spending a thousand elsewhere. I would rather stand at the entrance to the temple of my God than live in the tents of the wicked.
[Ps 84:11] For the Lord God is our sovereign protector. The Lord bestows favor and honor; he withholds no good thing from those who have integrity.
[Ps 84:12] O Lord of Heaven’s Armies, how blessed are those who trust in you!

## Prayer for the restoration of God's presence
¶[Ps 85:4] Restore us, O God our deliverer! Do not be displeased with us!

[Ps 85:6] Will you not revive us once more? Then your people will rejoice in you!
[Ps 85:7] O Lord, show us your loyal love! Bestow on us your deliverance!

## The anticipated manifestation of God's loving-kindness
¶[Ps 85:8] I will listen to what God the Lord says. For he will make peace with his people, his faithful followers. Yet they must not return to their foolish ways.
[Ps 85:9] Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance; then his splendor will again appear in our land.
[Ps 85:10] Loyal love and faithfulness meet; deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.
[Ps 85:11] Faithfulness grows from the ground, and deliverance looks down from the sky.

## The Sacred City: The City of God
¶[Ps 87:2] The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.
[Ps 87:3] People say wonderful things about you, O city of God. (Selah)

## The Nations' Acknowledgment of Zion
¶[Ps 87:4] I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers. Here are Philistia and Tyre, along with Ethiopia. It is said of them, “This one was born there.”

## An appeal for help in affliction
¶[Ps 88:1] A song, a psalm written by the Korahites; for the music director; according to the machalath-leannoth style; a well-written song by Heman the Ezrachite. O Lord God who delivers me! By day I cry out and at night I pray before you.
[Ps 88:2] Listen to my prayer! Pay attention to my cry for help!
[Ps 88:3] For my life is filled with troubles and I am ready to enter Sheol.
[Ps 88:4] They treat me like those who descend into the grave. I am like a helpless man,
[Ps 88:5] adrift among the dead, like corpses lying in the grave, whom you remember no more, and who are cut off from your power.

## Feeling forsaken by God
¶[Ps 88:6] You place me in the lowest regions of the Pit, in the dark places, in the watery depths.
[Ps 88:7] Your anger bears down on me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. (Selah)
[Ps 88:8] You cause those who know me to keep their distance; you make me an appalling sight to them. I am trapped and cannot get free.
[Ps 88:9] My eyes grow weak because of oppression. I call out to you, O Lord, all day long; I spread out my hands in prayer to you.

## A plea for God's intervention
¶[Ps 88:10] Do you accomplish amazing things for the dead? Do the departed spirits rise up and give you thanks? (Selah)
[Ps 88:11] Is your loyal love proclaimed in the grave, or your faithfulness in the place of the dead?
[Ps 88:12] Are your amazing deeds experienced in the dark region, or your deliverance in the land of oblivion?

## A persistent cry for help
¶[Ps 88:13] As for me, I cry out to you, O Lord; in the morning my prayer confronts you.
[Ps 88:14] O Lord, why do you reject me, and pay no attention to me?
[Ps 88:15] I am oppressed and have been on the verge of death since my youth. I have been subjected to your horrors and am numb with pain.

## Suffering under God's wrath and abandonment
¶[Ps 88:16] Your anger overwhelms me; your terrors destroy me.
[Ps 88:17] They surround me like water all day long; they join forces and encircle me.
[Ps 88:18] You cause my friends and neighbors to keep their distance; those who know me leave me alone in the darkness.


# Psalms 89

## Introduction: God's Covenant with David
¶[Ps 89:1] A well-written song by Ethan the Ezrachite. I will sing continually about the Lord’s faithful deeds; to future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness.
[Ps 89:2] For I say, “Loyal love is permanently established; in the skies you set up your faithfulness.”
[Ps 89:3] The Lord said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have made a promise on oath to David, my servant:
[Ps 89:4] ‘I will give you an eternal dynasty and establish your throne throughout future generations.’” (Selah)

## God's Majesty and Sovereignty
¶[Ps 89:5] O Lord, the heavens praise your amazing deeds, as well as your faithfulness in the angelic assembly.
[Ps 89:6] For who in the skies can compare to the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings,
[Ps 89:7] a God who is honored in the great angelic assembly, and more awesome than all who surround him?
[Ps 89:8] O Lord God of Heaven’s Armies! Who is strong like you, O Lord? Your faithfulness surrounds you.
[Ps 89:9] You rule over the proud sea. When its waves surge, you calm them.
[Ps 89:10] You crushed the Proud One and killed it; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
[Ps 89:11] The heavens belong to you, as does the earth. You made the world and all it contains.
[Ps 89:12] You created the north and the south. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
[Ps 89:13] Your arm is powerful, your hand strong, your right hand victorious.
[Ps 89:14] Equity and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loyal love and faithfulness characterize your rule.

## Blessings of God's People
¶[Ps 89:15] How blessed are the people who worship you! O Lord, they experience your favor.
[Ps 89:16] They rejoice in your name all day long, and are vindicated by your justice.
[Ps 89:17] For you give them splendor and strength. By your favor we are victorious.
[Ps 89:18] For our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the Holy One of Israel.

## The Lord's Choice of David
¶[Ps 89:19] Then you spoke through a vision to your faithful followers and said: “I have placed a young hero over a warrior; I have raised up a young man from the people.
[Ps 89:20] I have discovered David, my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him as king.
[Ps 89:21] My hand will support him, and my arm will strengthen him.
[Ps 89:22] No enemy will be able to exact tribute from him; a violent oppressor will not be able to humiliate him.
[Ps 89:23] I will crush his enemies before him; I will strike down those who hate him.
[Ps 89:24] He will experience my faithfulness and loyal love, and by my name he will win victories.
[Ps 89:25] I will place his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.
[Ps 89:26] He will call out to me, ‘You are my father, my God, and the protector who delivers me.’
[Ps 89:27] I will appoint him to be my firstborn son, the most exalted of the earth’s kings.
[Ps 89:28] I will always extend my loyal love to him, and my covenant with him is secure.
[Ps 89:29] I will give him an eternal dynasty, and make his throne as enduring as the skies above.

## Consequences of Disobedience
¶[Ps 89:30] If his sons reject my law and disobey my regulations,
[Ps 89:31] if they break my rules and do not keep my commandments,
[Ps 89:32] I will punish their rebellion by beating them with a club, their sin by inflicting them with bruises.
[Ps 89:33] But I will not remove my loyal love from him, nor be unfaithful to my promise.
[Ps 89:34] I will not break my covenant or go back on what I promised.
[Ps 89:35] Once and for all I have vowed by my own holiness, I will never deceive David.
[Ps 89:36] His dynasty will last forever. His throne will endure before me, like the sun,
[Ps 89:37] it will remain stable, like the moon, his throne will endure like the skies.” (Selah)
[Ps 89:38] But you have spurned and rejected him; you are angry with your chosen king.
[Ps 89:39] You have repudiated your covenant with your servant; you have thrown his crown to the ground.
[Ps 89:40] You have broken down all his walls; you have made his strongholds a heap of ruins.
[Ps 89:41] All who pass by have robbed him; he has become an object of disdain to his neighbors.
[Ps 89:42] You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious, and all his enemies to rejoice.
[Ps 89:43] You turn back his sword from the adversary, and have not sustained him in battle.
[Ps 89:44] You have brought to an end his splendor, and have knocked his throne to the ground.
[Ps 89:45] You have cut short his youth, and have covered him with shame. (Selah)

## Plea for God's Restoration and Mercy
¶[Ps 89:46] How long, O Lord, will this last? Will you remain hidden forever? Will your anger continue to burn like fire?
[Ps 89:47] Take note of my brief lifespan! Why do you make all people so mortal?
[Ps 89:48] No man can live on without experiencing death, or deliver his life from the power of Sheol. (Selah)
[Ps 89:49] Where are your earlier faithful deeds, O Lord, the ones performed in accordance with your reliable oath to David?
[Ps 89:50] Take note, O Lord, of the way your servants are taunted, and of how I must bear so many insults from people!
[Ps 89:51] Your enemies, O Lord, hurl insults; they insult your chosen king as they dog his footsteps.
[Ps 89:52] The Lord deserves praise forevermore! We agree! We agree!

## A Warning to the Foolish and Wicked
¶[Ps 94:8] Take notice of this, you ignorant people! You fools, when will you ever understand?
[Ps 94:9] Does the one who makes the human ear not hear? Does the one who forms the human eye not see?
[Ps 94:10] Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish? He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings!

¶[Ps 101:5] I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret. I will not tolerate anyone who has a haughty demeanor and an arrogant attitude.
[Ps 101:6] I will favor the honest people of the land, and allow them to live with me. Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me.

## Eliminating Wickedness from the Kingdom
¶[Ps 101:7] Deceitful people will not live in my palace. Liars will not be welcome in my presence.
[Ps 101:8] Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land, and remove all evildoers from the city of the Lord.


# Psalms 102

## Introduction: A Prayer of the Afflicted
¶[Ps 102:1] The prayer of an oppressed man, as he grows faint and pours out his lament before the Lord. O Lord, hear my prayer! Pay attention to my cry for help!
[Ps 102:2] Do not ignore me in my time of trouble! Listen to me! When I call out to you, quickly answer me!

## The Psalmist's Lament and Suffering
¶[Ps 102:3] For my days go up in smoke, and my bones are charred like a fireplace.
[Ps 102:4] My heart is parched and withered like grass, for I am unable to eat food.
[Ps 102:5] Because of the anxiety that makes me groan, my bones protrude from my skin.
[Ps 102:6] I am like an owl in the wilderness; I am like a screech owl among the ruins.
[Ps 102:7] I stay awake; I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
[Ps 102:8] All day long my enemies taunt me; those who mock me use my name in their curses.
[Ps 102:9] For I eat ashes as if they were bread, and mix my drink with my tears,
[Ps 102:10] because of your anger and raging fury. Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away.
[Ps 102:11] My days are coming to an end, and I am withered like grass.

## The Eternality and Mercy of God
¶[Ps 102:12] But you, O Lord, rule forever, and your reputation endures.
[Ps 102:13] You will rise up and have compassion on Zion. For it is time to have mercy on her, for the appointed time has come.
[Ps 102:14] Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones, and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.
[Ps 102:15] The nations will respect the reputation of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor,
[Ps 102:16] when the Lord rebuilds Zion, and reveals his splendor,
[Ps 102:17] when he responds to the prayer of the destitute, and does not reject their request.

## The Future Restoration of Zion
¶[Ps 102:18] The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations; people yet to be born will praise the Lord.
[Ps 102:19] For he will look down from his sanctuary above; from heaven the Lord will look toward earth,
[Ps 102:20] in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners, and to set free those condemned to die,
[Ps 102:21] so they may proclaim the name of the Lord in Zion, and praise him in Jerusalem,
[Ps 102:22] when the nations gather together, and the kingdoms pay tribute to the Lord.

## The Fragility of Human Life and God's Eternal Nature
¶[Ps 102:23] He has taken away my strength in the middle of life; he has cut short my days.
[Ps 102:24] I say, “O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life! You endure through all generations.
[Ps 102:25] In earlier times you established the earth; the skies are your handiwork.
[Ps 102:26] They will perish, but you will endure. They will wear out like a garment; like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear.
[Ps 102:27] But you remain; your years do not come to an end.
[Ps 102:28] The children of your servants will settle down here, and their descendants will live securely in your presence.”


# Psalms 103

## Praise for God's Tender Mercies
¶[Ps 103:1] By David. Praise the Lord, O my soul! With all that is within me, praise his holy name!
[Ps 103:2] Praise the Lord, O my soul! Do not forget all his kind deeds!
[Ps 103:3] He is the one who forgives all your sins, who heals all your diseases,
[Ps 103:4] who delivers your life from the Pit, who crowns you with his loyal love and compassion,
[Ps 103:5] who satisfies your life with good things, so your youth is renewed like an eagle’s.

## God's Compassionate Character
¶[Ps 103:6] The Lord does what is fair, and executes justice for all the oppressed.
[Ps 103:7] The Lord revealed his faithful acts to Moses, his deeds to the Israelites.
[Ps 103:8] The Lord is compassionate and merciful; he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love.
[Ps 103:9] He does not always accuse, and does not stay angry.
[Ps 103:10] He does not deal with us as our sins deserve; he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve.
[Ps 103:11] For as the skies are high above the earth, so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers.
[Ps 103:12] As far as the eastern horizon is from the west, so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us.
[Ps 103:13] As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on his faithful followers.
[Ps 103:14] For he knows what we are made of; he realizes we are made of clay.

## The Frailty of Human Life and the Everlasting Nature of God's Love
¶[Ps 103:15] A person’s life is like grass. Like a flower in the field it flourishes,
[Ps 103:16] but when the hot wind blows by, it disappears, and one can no longer even spot the place where it once grew.
[Ps 103:17] But the Lord continually shows loyal love to his faithful followers, and is faithful to their descendants,
[Ps 103:18] to those who keep his covenant, who are careful to obey his commands.

## The Universal Call to Praise the Lord
¶[Ps 103:19] The Lord has established his throne in heaven; his kingdom extends over everything.
[Ps 103:20] Praise the Lord, you angels of his, you powerful warriors who carry out his decrees and obey his orders!
[Ps 103:21] Praise the Lord, all you warriors of his, you servants of his who carry out his desires!
[Ps 103:22] Praise the Lord, all that he has made, in all the regions of his kingdom! Praise the Lord, O my soul!


# Psalms 104

## Praise for the Creator's Majesty and Wisdom
¶[Ps 104:1] Praise the Lord, O my soul! O Lord my God, you are magnificent. You are robed in splendor and majesty.
[Ps 104:2] He covers himself with light as if it were a garment. He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain,
[Ps 104:3] and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds. He makes the clouds his chariot, and travels along on the wings of the wind.
[Ps 104:4] He makes the winds his messengers, and the flaming fire his attendant.

## The Beauty and Order of God's Creation
¶[Ps 104:5] He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be moved.
[Ps 104:6] The watery deep covered it like a garment; the waters reached above the mountains.
[Ps 104:7] Your shout made the waters retreat; at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off –
[Ps 104:8] as the mountains rose up, and the valleys went down – to the place you appointed for them.
[Ps 104:9] You set up a boundary for them that they could not cross, so that they would not cover the earth again.
[Ps 104:10] He turns springs into streams; they flow between the mountains.
[Ps 104:11] They provide water for all the animals in the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
[Ps 104:12] The birds of the sky live beside them; they chirp among the bushes.
[Ps 104:13] He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace; the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow.
[Ps 104:14] He provides grass for the cattle, and crops for people to cultivate, so they can produce food from the ground,
[Ps 104:15] as well as wine that makes people feel so good, and so they can have oil to make their faces shine, as well as food that sustains people’s lives.
[Ps 104:16] The trees of the Lord receive all the rain they need, the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,
[Ps 104:17] where the birds make nests, near the evergreens in which the herons live.
[Ps 104:18] The wild goats live in the high mountains; the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs.

## The Interdependence of God's Creatures
¶[Ps 104:19] He made the moon to mark the months, and the sun sets according to a regular schedule.
[Ps 104:20] You make it dark and night comes, during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around.
[Ps 104:21] The lions roar for prey, seeking their food from God.
[Ps 104:22] When the sun rises, they withdraw and sleep in their dens.
[Ps 104:23] Men then go out to do their work, and labor away until evening.
[Ps 104:24] How many living things you have made, O Lord! You have exhibited great skill in making all of them; the earth is full of the living things you have made.

## The Vastness and Mystery of God's Creation
¶[Ps 104:25] Over here is the deep, wide sea, which teems with innumerable swimming creatures, living things both small and large.
[Ps 104:26] The ships travel there, and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.
[Ps 104:27] All of your creatures wait for you to provide them with food on a regular basis.
[Ps 104:28] You give food to them and they receive it; you open your hand and they are filled with food.
[Ps 104:29] When you ignore them, they panic. When you take away their life’s breath, they die and return to dust.
[Ps 104:30] When you send your life-giving breath, they are created, and you replenish the surface of the ground.

## The Role of Humanity in Praising and Preserving God's Creation
¶[Ps 104:31] May the splendor of the Lord endure! May the Lord find pleasure in the living things he has made!
[Ps 104:32] He looks down on the earth and it shakes; he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.
[Ps 104:33] I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!
[Ps 104:34] May my thoughts be pleasing to him! I will rejoice in the Lord.
[Ps 104:35] May sinners disappear from the earth, and the wicked vanish! Praise the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!

[Ps 105:7] He is the Lord our God; he carries out judgment throughout the earth.
[Ps 105:8] He always remembers his covenantal decree, the promise he made to a thousand generations –
[Ps 105:9] the promise he made to Abraham, the promise he made by oath to Isaac!
[Ps 105:10] He gave it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as a lasting promise,
[Ps 105:11] saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance.”

## God's Providence During Israel's Wandering in Canaan
¶[Ps 105:12] When they were few in number, just a very few, and resident foreigners within it,
[Ps 105:13] they wandered from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another.
[Ps 105:14] He let no one oppress them; he disciplined kings for their sake,
[Ps 105:15] saying, “Don’t touch my chosen ones! Don’t harm my prophets!”
[Ps 105:16] He called down a famine upon the earth; he cut off all the food supply.
[Ps 105:17] He sent a man ahead of them – Joseph was sold as a servant.
[Ps 105:18] The shackles hurt his feet; his neck was placed in an iron collar,
[Ps 105:19] until the time when his prediction came true. The Lord’s word proved him right.
[Ps 105:20] The king authorized his release; the ruler of nations set him free.
[Ps 105:21] He put him in charge of his palace, and made him manager of all his property,
[Ps 105:22] giving him authority to imprison his officials and to teach his advisers.
[Ps 105:23] Israel moved to Egypt; Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
[Ps 105:24] The Lord made his people very fruitful, and made them more numerous than their enemies.

## God's Miraculous Plagues in Egypt
¶[Ps 105:25] He caused them to hate his people, and to mistreat his servants.
[Ps 105:26] He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
[Ps 105:27] They executed his miraculous signs among them, and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham.
[Ps 105:28] He made it dark; they did not disobey his orders.
[Ps 105:29] He turned their water into blood, and killed their fish.
[Ps 105:30] Their land was overrun by frogs, which even got into the rooms of their kings.
[Ps 105:31] He ordered flies to come; gnats invaded their whole territory.
[Ps 105:32] He sent hail along with the rain; there was lightning in their land.
[Ps 105:33] He destroyed their vines and fig trees, and broke the trees throughout their territory.
[Ps 105:34] He ordered locusts to come, innumerable grasshoppers.
[Ps 105:35] They ate all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the crops of their fields.
[Ps 105:36] He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of their reproductive power.
[Ps 105:37] He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold; none of his tribes stumbled.
[Ps 105:38] Egypt was happy when they left, for they were afraid of them.

## God's Guidance and Provision in the Wilderness
¶[Ps 105:39] He spread out a cloud for a cover, and provided a fire to light up the night.
[Ps 105:40] They asked for food, and he sent quails; he satisfied them with food from the sky.
[Ps 105:41] He opened up a rock and water flowed out; a river ran through dry regions.
[Ps 105:42] Yes, he remembered the sacred promise he made to Abraham his servant.
[Ps 105:43] When he led his people out, they rejoiced; his chosen ones shouted with joy.
[Ps 105:44] He handed the territory of nations over to them, and they took possession of what other peoples had produced,
[Ps 105:45] so that they might keep his commands and obey his laws. Praise the Lord!


# Psalms 106

## Introduction: Praise to the Lord
¶[Ps 106:1] Praise the Lord! Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, and his loyal love endures!
[Ps 106:2] Who can adequately recount the Lord’s mighty acts, or relate all his praiseworthy deeds?
[Ps 106:3] How blessed are those who promote justice, and do what is right all the time!
[Ps 106:4] Remember me, O Lord, when you show favor to your people! Pay attention to me, when you deliver,
[Ps 106:5] so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, rejoice along with your nation, and boast along with the people who belong to you.

## Israel's History of Sin and God's Deliverance
¶[Ps 106:6] We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, we have done evil.
[Ps 106:7] Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds, they failed to remember your many acts of loyal love, and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
[Ps 106:8] Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation, that he might reveal his power.
[Ps 106:9] He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up; he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
[Ps 106:10] He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them, and rescued them from the power of the enemy.
[Ps 106:11] The water covered their enemies; not even one of them survived.
[Ps 106:12] They believed his promises; they sang praises to him.
[Ps 106:13] They quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions.
[Ps 106:14] In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; they challenged God in the wastelands.
[Ps 106:15] He granted their request, then struck them with a disease.
[Ps 106:16] In the camp they resented Moses, and Aaron, the Lord’s holy priest.
[Ps 106:17] The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it engulfed the group led by Abiram.
[Ps 106:18] Fire burned their group; the flames scorched the wicked.
[Ps 106:19] They made an image of a calf at Horeb, and worshiped a metal idol.
[Ps 106:20] They traded their majestic God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
[Ps 106:21] They rejected the God who delivered them, the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
[Ps 106:22] amazing feats in the land of Ham, mighty acts by the Red Sea.
[Ps 106:23] He threatened to destroy them, but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him and turned back his destructive anger.
[Ps 106:24] They rejected the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise.
[Ps 106:25] They grumbled in their tents; they did not obey the Lord.
[Ps 106:26] So he made a solemn vow that he would make them die in the wilderness,
[Ps 106:27] make their descendants die among the nations, and scatter them among foreign lands.
[Ps 106:28] They worshiped Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
[Ps 106:29] They made the Lord angry by their actions, and a plague broke out among them.
[Ps 106:30] Phinehas took a stand and intervened, and the plague subsided.
[Ps 106:31] This was credited to him as a righteous act for all generations to come.
[Ps 106:32] They made him angry by the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them,
[Ps 106:33] for they aroused his temper, and he spoke rashly.
[Ps 106:34] They did not destroy the nations, as the Lord had commanded them to do.
[Ps 106:35] They mixed in with the nations and learned their ways.
[Ps 106:36] They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
[Ps 106:37] They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
[Ps 106:38] They shed innocent blood – the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted by bloodshed.
[Ps 106:39] They were defiled by their deeds, and unfaithful in their actions.
[Ps 106:40] So the Lord was angry with his people and despised the people who belong to him.
[Ps 106:41] He handed them over to the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
[Ps 106:42] Their enemies oppressed them; they were subject to their authority.
[Ps 106:43] Many times he delivered them, but they had a rebellious attitude, and degraded themselves by their sin.
[Ps 106:44] Yet he took notice of their distress, when he heard their cry for help.
[Ps 106:45] He remembered his covenant with them, and relented because of his great loyal love.
[Ps 106:46] He caused all their conquerors to have pity on them.

## Closing Prayer for Restoration and Praise
¶[Ps 106:47] Deliver us, O Lord, our God! Gather us from among the nations! Then we will give thanks to your holy name, and boast about your praiseworthy deeds.
[Ps 106:48] The Lord God of Israel deserves praise, in the future and forevermore. Let all the people say, “We agree! Praise the Lord!”

[Ps 107:3] and gathered from foreign lands, from east and west, from north and south.

## God's Deliverance of Wanderers in the Wilderness
¶[Ps 107:4] They wandered through the wilderness, in a wasteland; they found no road to a city in which to live.

[Ps 107:6] They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
[Ps 107:7] He led them on a level road, that they might find a city in which to live.
[Ps 107:8] Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
[Ps 107:9] For he has satisfied those who thirst, and those who hunger he has filled with food.

## God's Deliverance of Prisoners from Darkness
¶[Ps 107:10] They sat in utter darkness, bound in painful iron chains,
[Ps 107:11] because they had rebelled against God’s commands, and rejected the instructions of the Most High.
[Ps 107:12] So he used suffering to humble them; they stumbled and no one helped them up.
[Ps 107:13] They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
[Ps 107:14] He brought them out of the utter darkness, and tore off their shackles.
[Ps 107:15] Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
[Ps 107:16] For he shattered the bronze gates, and hacked through the iron bars.

## God's Healing of the Sick and Afflicted
¶[Ps 107:17] They acted like fools in their rebellious ways, and suffered because of their sins.
[Ps 107:18] They lost their appetite for all food, and they drew near the gates of death.
[Ps 107:19] They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
[Ps 107:20] He sent them an assuring word and healed them; he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped.
[Ps 107:21] Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
[Ps 107:22] Let them present thank offerings, and loudly proclaim what he has done!

## God's Help for Seafarers in the Stormy Sea
¶[Ps 107:23] Some traveled on the sea in ships, and carried cargo over the vast waters.
[Ps 107:24] They witnessed the acts of the Lord, his amazing feats on the deep water.
[Ps 107:25] He gave the order for a windstorm, and it stirred up the waves of the sea.
[Ps 107:26] They reached up to the sky, then dropped into the depths. The sailors’ strength left them because the danger was so great.
[Ps 107:27] They swayed and staggered like a drunk, and all their skill proved ineffective.
[Ps 107:28] They cried out to the Lord in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
[Ps 107:29] He calmed the storm, and the waves grew silent.
[Ps 107:30] The sailors rejoiced because the waves grew quiet, and he led them to the harbor they desired.
[Ps 107:31] Let them give thanks to the Lord for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
[Ps 107:32] Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people! Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside!

## God's Providence Over the Changing Fortunes of People
¶[Ps 107:33] He turned streams into a desert, springs of water into arid land,
[Ps 107:34] and a fruitful land into a barren place, because of the sin of its inhabitants.
[Ps 107:35] As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into springs of water.
[Ps 107:36] He allowed the hungry to settle there, and they established a city in which to live.
[Ps 107:37] They cultivated fields, and planted vineyards, which yielded a harvest of fruit.
[Ps 107:38] He blessed them so that they became very numerous. He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number.
[Ps 107:39] As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down, because of painful distress and suffering.
[Ps 107:40] He would pour contempt upon princes, and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road.
[Ps 107:41] Yet he protected the needy from oppression, and cared for his families like a flock of sheep.
[Ps 107:42] When the godly see this, they rejoice, and every sinner shuts his mouth.

## Conclusion: The Wisdom of God's Powerful Works

# Psalms 109

[Ps 109:3] They surround me and say hateful things; they attack me for no reason.

¶[Ps 109:16] For he never bothered to show kindness; he harassed the oppressed and needy, and killed the disheartened.

## Prayer for Vindication
¶[Ps 109:21] O sovereign Lord, intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation! Because your loyal love is good, deliver me!
[Ps 109:22] For I am oppressed and needy, and my heart beats violently within me.
[Ps 109:23] I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day; I am shaken off like a locust.
[Ps 109:24] I am so starved my knees shake; I have turned into skin and bones.
[Ps 109:25] I am disdained by them. When they see me, they shake their heads.
[Ps 109:26] Help me, O Lord my God! Because you are faithful to me, deliver me!
[Ps 109:27] Then they will realize this is your work, and that you, Lord, have accomplished it.
[Ps 109:28] They curse, but you will bless. When they attack, they will be humiliated, but your servant will rejoice.
[Ps 109:29] My accusers will be covered with shame, and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.

## Declaration of Praise

[Ps 109:31] because he stands at the right hand of the needy, to deliver him from those who threaten his life.
