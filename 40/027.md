# Matthew 27

## Jesus before Pilate
¶[Matt 27:1] When it was early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him.
[Matt 27:2] They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.

¶[Matt 27:3] Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders,
[Matt 27:4] saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!”
[Matt 27:5] So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left. Then he went out and hanged himself.
[Matt 27:6] The chief priests took the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.”
[Matt 27:7] After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it, as a burial place for foreigners.
[Matt 27:8] For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day.
[Matt 27:9] Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one whose price had been set by the people of Israel,
[Matt 27:10] and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”

¶[Matt 27:11] Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.”
[Matt 27:12] But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond.
[Matt 27:13] Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?”
[Matt 27:14] But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.
[Matt 27:15] During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted.
[Matt 27:16] At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
[Matt 27:17] So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?”
[Matt 27:18] (For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.)
[Matt 27:19] As he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man; I have suffered greatly as a result of a dream about him today.”
[Matt 27:20] But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
[Matt 27:21] The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”
[Matt 27:22] Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” They all said, “Crucify him!”
[Matt 27:23] He asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!”
[Matt 27:24] When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was starting, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. You take care of it yourselves!”
[Matt 27:25] In reply all the people said, “Let his blood be on us and on our children!”
[Matt 27:26] Then he released Barabbas for them. But after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.

## The Soldiers Mock Jesus
¶[Matt 27:27] Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort around him.
[Matt 27:28] They stripped him and put a scarlet robe around him,
[Matt 27:29] and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand, and kneeling down before him, they mocked him: “Hail, king of the Jews!”
[Matt 27:30] They spat on him and took the staff and struck him repeatedly on the head.
[Matt 27:31] When they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.

## The Crucifixion
¶[Matt 27:32] As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry his cross.

¶[Matt 27:33] They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Place of the Skull”)
[Matt 27:34] and offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. But after tasting it, he would not drink it.
[Matt 27:35] When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.
[Matt 27:36] Then they sat down and kept guard over him there.
[Matt 27:37] Above his head they put the charge against him, which read: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”
[Matt 27:38] Then two outlaws were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
[Matt 27:39] Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads
[Matt 27:40] and saying, “You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are God’s Son, come down from the cross!”
[Matt 27:41] In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law and elders – were mocking him:
[Matt 27:42] “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel! If he comes down now from the cross, we will believe in him!
[Matt 27:43] He trusts in God – let God, if he wants to, deliver him now because he said, ‘I am God’s Son’!”
[Matt 27:44] The robbers who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him.

## Jesus' Death, Burial, and Resurrection
¶[Matt 27:45] Now from noon until three, darkness came over all the land.
[Matt 27:46] At about three o’clock Jesus shouted with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
[Matt 27:47] When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.”
[Matt 27:48] Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink.
[Matt 27:49] But the rest said, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to save him.”
[Matt 27:50] Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
[Matt 27:51] Just then the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks were split apart.
[Matt 27:52] And tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised.
[Matt 27:53] (They came out of the tombs after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.)
[Matt 27:54] Now when the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place, they were extremely terrified and said, “Truly this one was God’s Son!”
[Matt 27:55] Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there, watching from a distance.
[Matt 27:56] Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

¶[Matt 27:57] Now when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
[Matt 27:58] He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
[Matt 27:59] Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
[Matt 27:60] and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away.
[Matt 27:61] (Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, opposite the tomb.)

¶[Matt 27:62] The next day (which is after the day of preparation) the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate
[Matt 27:63] and said, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
[Matt 27:64] So give orders to secure the tomb until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal his body and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”
[Matt 27:65] Pilate said to them, “Take a guard of soldiers. Go and make it as secure as you can.”
[Matt 27:66] So they went with the soldiers of the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.
