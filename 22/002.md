# Song of Songs 2

## The Shulamite Praises the Beloved's Appearance
¶[Song 2:1] I am a meadow flower from Sharon, a lily from the valleys.
[Song 2:2] Like a lily among the thorns, so is my darling among the maidens.
[Song 2:3] Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.

## The Beloved Offers Comfort and Security
¶[Song 2:4] He brought me into the banquet hall, and he looked at me lovingly.
[Song 2:5] Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love. The Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration
[Song 2:6] His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.

## The Shulamite Requests to be Uninterrupted in Love
¶[Song 2:7] I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields: Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!

## The Shulamite Dreams of the Beloved's Arrival
¶[Song 2:8] Listen! My lover is approaching! Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills!
[Song 2:9] My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering through the lattice.
[Song 2:10] My lover spoke to me, saying: “Arise, my darling; My beautiful one, come away with me!
[Song 2:11] Look! The winter has passed, the winter rains are over and gone.
[Song 2:12] Blossoms have appeared in the land, the time for pruning and singing has come; the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
[Song 2:13] The fig tree has ripened its figs, the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance. Arise, come away my darling; my beautiful one, come away with me!”

## The Shulamite Senses the Beloved's Presence
¶[Song 2:14] O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the mountain crags, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
[Song 2:15] Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards – for our vineyard is in bloom.

## The Shulamite Reflects on Their Mutual Love
¶[Song 2:16] My lover is mine and I am his; he grazes among the lilies.
[Song 2:17] Until the dawn arrives and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved – be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountain gorges.
