# Proverbs 6

## Wisdom vs. Folly
¶[Prov 6:1] My child, if you have made a pledge for your neighbor, if you have become a guarantor for a stranger,
[Prov 6:2] if you have been ensnared by the words you have uttered, and have been caught by the words you have spoken,
[Prov 6:3] then, my child, do this in order to deliver yourself, because you have fallen into your neighbor’s power: go, humble yourself, and appeal firmly to your neighbor.
[Prov 6:4] Permit no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.
[Prov 6:5] Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a snare, and like a bird from the trap of the fowler.

## Warnings against Laziness
¶[Prov 6:6] Go to the ant, you sluggard; observe its ways and be wise!
[Prov 6:7] It has no commander, overseer, or ruler,
[Prov 6:8] yet it would prepare its food in the summer; it gathered at the harvest what it will eat.
[Prov 6:9] How long, you sluggard, will you lie there? When will you rise from your sleep?
[Prov 6:10] A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to relax,
[Prov 6:11] and your poverty will come like a robber, and your need like an armed man.

## Warnings against Mischief
¶[Prov 6:12] A worthless and wicked person walks around saying perverse things;
[Prov 6:13] he winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, and points with his fingers;
[Prov 6:14] he plots evil with perverse thoughts in his heart, he spreads contention at all times.
[Prov 6:15] Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly; in an instant he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.
[Prov 6:16] There are six things that the Lord hates, even seven things that are an abomination to him:
[Prov 6:17] haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
[Prov 6:18] a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that are swift to run to evil,
[Prov 6:19] a false witness who pours out lies, and a person who spreads discord among family members.

## Warnings against Adultery
¶[Prov 6:20] My child, guard the commands of your father and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.
[Prov 6:21] Bind them on your heart continually; fasten them around your neck.
[Prov 6:22] When you walk about, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you wake up, they will talk to you.
[Prov 6:23] For the commandments are like a lamp, instruction is like a light, and rebukes of discipline are like the road leading to life,
[Prov 6:24] by keeping you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the loose woman.
[Prov 6:25] Do not lust in your heart for her beauty, and do not let her captivate you with her alluring eyes;
[Prov 6:26] for on account of a prostitute one is brought down to a loaf of bread, but the wife of another man preys on your precious life.
[Prov 6:27] Can a man hold fire against his chest without burning his clothes?
[Prov 6:28] Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?
[Prov 6:29] So it is with the one who sleeps with his neighbor’s wife; no one who touches her will escape punishment.
[Prov 6:30] People do not despise a thief when he steals to fulfill his need when he is hungry.
[Prov 6:31] Yet if he is caught he must repay seven times over, he might even have to give all the wealth of his house.
[Prov 6:32] A man who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense, whoever does it destroys his own life.
[Prov 6:33] He will be beaten and despised, and his reproach will not be wiped away;
[Prov 6:34] for jealousy kindles a husband’s rage, and he will not show mercy when he takes revenge.
[Prov 6:35] He will not consider any compensation; he will not be willing, even if you multiply the compensation.
