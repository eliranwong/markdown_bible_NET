# Exodus 16

## Manna and quail provided by God
¶[Exod 16:1] When they journeyed from Elim, the entire company of Israelites came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their exodus from the land of Egypt.
[Exod 16:2] The entire company of Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[Exod 16:3] The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when we ate bread to the full, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger!”

¶[Exod 16:4] Then the Lord said to Moses, “I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people will go out and gather the amount for each day, so that I may test them. Will they walk in my law or not?
[Exod 16:5] On the sixth day they will prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather every other day.”
[Exod 16:6] Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt,
[Exod 16:7] and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your murmurings against the Lord. As for us, what are we, that you should murmur against us?”
[Exod 16:8] Moses said, “You will know this when the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to satisfy you, because the Lord has heard your murmurings that you are murmuring against him. As for us, what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.”
[Exod 16:9] Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole community of the Israelites, ‘Come before the Lord, because he has heard your murmurings.’”
[Exod 16:10] As Aaron spoke to the whole community of the Israelites and they looked toward the wilderness, there the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud,
[Exod 16:11] and the Lord spoke to Moses:
[Exod 16:12] “I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘During the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread, so that you may know that I am the Lord your God.’”

¶[Exod 16:13] In the evening the quail came up and covered the camp, and in the morning a layer of dew was all around the camp.
[Exod 16:14] When the layer of dew had evaporated, there on the surface of the wilderness was a thin flaky substance, thin like frost on the earth.
[Exod 16:15] When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” because they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the Lord has given you for food.
[Exod 16:16] “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Each person is to gather from it what he can eat, an omer per person according to the number of your people; each one will pick it up for whoever lives in his tent.’”
[Exod 16:17] The Israelites did so, and they gathered – some more, some less.
[Exod 16:18] When they measured with an omer, the one who gathered much had nothing left over, and the one who gathered little lacked nothing; each one had gathered what he could eat.
[Exod 16:19] Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”
[Exod 16:20] But they did not listen to Moses; some kept part of it until morning, and it was full of worms and began to stink, and Moses was angry with them.
[Exod 16:21] So they gathered it each morning, each person according to what he could eat, and when the sun got hot, it would melt.
[Exod 16:22] And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, two omers per person; and all the leaders of the community came and told Moses.
[Exod 16:23] He said to them, “This is what the Lord has said: ‘Tomorrow is a time of cessation from work, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Whatever you want to bake, bake today; whatever you want to boil, boil today; whatever is left put aside for yourselves to be kept until morning.’”
[Exod 16:24] So they put it aside until the morning, just as Moses had commanded, and it did not stink, nor were there any worms in it.
[Exod 16:25] Moses said, “Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the area.
[Exod 16:26] Six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”
[Exod 16:27] On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather it, but they found nothing.
[Exod 16:28] So the Lord said to Moses, “How long do you refuse to obey my commandments and my instructions?
[Exod 16:29] See, because the Lord has given you the Sabbath, that is why he is giving you food for two days on the sixth day. Each of you stay where you are; let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.”
[Exod 16:30] So the people rested on the seventh day.

¶[Exod 16:31] The house of Israel called its name “manna.” It was like coriander seed and was white, and it tasted like wafers with honey.
[Exod 16:32] Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Fill an omer with it to be kept for generations to come, so that they may see the food I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.’”
[Exod 16:33] Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put in it an omer full of manna, and place it before the Lord to be kept for generations to come.”
[Exod 16:34] Just as the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the Testimony for safekeeping.
[Exod 16:35] Now the Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was inhabited; they ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
[Exod 16:36] (Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.)
