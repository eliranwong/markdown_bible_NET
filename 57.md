# Philemon 1

## Salutation
¶[Phlm 1:1] From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear friend and colaborer,
[Phlm 1:2] to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house.
[Phlm 1:3] Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!

## Paul's Thanksgiving for Philemon
¶[Phlm 1:4] I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
[Phlm 1:5] because I hear of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.

## Paul's Prayer for Philemon
¶[Phlm 1:6] I pray that the faith you share with us may deepen your understanding of every blessing that belongs to you in Christ.

## Philemon's Encouragement to Others
¶[Phlm 1:7] I have had great joy and encouragement because of your love, for the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

## An Appeal Instead of a Command
¶[Phlm 1:8] So, although I have quite a lot of confidence in Christ and could command you to do what is proper,
[Phlm 1:9] I would rather appeal to you on the basis of love – I, Paul, an old man and even now a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus –

## Introducing Onesimus
¶[Phlm 1:10] I am appealing to you concerning my child, whose spiritual father I have become during my imprisonment, that is, Onesimus,
[Phlm 1:11] who was formerly useless to you, but is now useful to you and me.

## Paul's Desire to be with Onesimus
¶[Phlm 1:12] I have sent him (who is my very heart) back to you.
[Phlm 1:13] I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the sake of the gospel.
[Phlm 1:14] However, without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be out of compulsion, but from your own willingness.

## Purpose of Onesimus's Departure
¶[Phlm 1:15] For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a little while, so that you would have him back eternally,
[Phlm 1:16] no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, as a dear brother. He is especially so to me, and even more so to you now, both humanly speaking and in the Lord.

## Philemon's Relationship with Paul
¶[Phlm 1:17] Therefore if you regard me as a partner, accept him as you would me.
[Phlm 1:18] Now if he has defrauded you of anything or owes you anything, charge what he owes to me.
[Phlm 1:19] I, Paul, have written this letter with my own hand: I will repay it. I could also mention that you owe me your very self.

## Paul's Expectation of Philemon's Obedience
¶[Phlm 1:20] Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.

¶[Phlm 1:21] Since I was confident that you would obey, I wrote to you, because I knew that you would do even more than what I am asking you to do.

## Paul's Hope to Visit
¶[Phlm 1:22] At the same time also, prepare a place for me to stay, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given back to you.

## Greetings from Fellow Workers
¶[Phlm 1:23] Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you.
[Phlm 1:24] Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my colaborers, greet you too.

## Conclusion with a Wish for Grace
¶[Phlm 1:25] May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
