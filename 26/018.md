# Ezekiel 18

## Individual Responsibility
¶[Ezek 18:1] The Lord’s message came to me:
[Ezek 18:2] “What do you mean by quoting this proverb concerning the land of Israel, “‘The fathers eat sour grapes And the children’s teeth become numb?’
[Ezek 18:3] “As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, you will not quote this proverb in Israel anymore!
[Ezek 18:4] Indeed! All lives are mine – the life of the father as well as the life of the son is mine. The one who sins will die.

¶[Ezek 18:5] “Suppose a man is righteous. He practices what is just and right,
[Ezek 18:6] does not eat pagan sacrifices on the mountains or pray to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife, does not approach a woman for marital relations during her period,
[Ezek 18:7] does not oppress anyone, but gives the debtor back whatever was given in pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and clothes the naked,
[Ezek 18:8] does not engage in usury or charge interest, but refrains from wrongdoing, promotes true justice between men,
[Ezek 18:9] and follows my statutes and observes my regulations by carrying them out. That man is righteous; he will certainly live, declares the Sovereign Lord.

¶[Ezek 18:10] “Suppose such a man has a violent son who sheds blood and does any of these things mentioned previously
[Ezek 18:11] (though the father did not do any of them). He eats pagan sacrifices on the mountains, defiles his neighbor’s wife,
[Ezek 18:12] oppresses the poor and the needy, commits robbery, does not give back what was given in pledge, prays to idols, performs abominable acts,
[Ezek 18:13] engages in usury and charges interest. Will he live? He will not! Because he has done all these abominable deeds he will certainly die. He will bear the responsibility for his own death.

¶[Ezek 18:14] “But suppose he in turn has a son who notices all the sins his father commits, considers them, and does not follow his father’s example.
[Ezek 18:15] He does not eat pagan sacrifices on the mountains, does not pray to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor’s wife,
[Ezek 18:16] does not oppress anyone or keep what has been given in pledge, does not commit robbery, gives his food to the hungry, and clothes the naked,
[Ezek 18:17] refrains from wrongdoing, does not engage in usury or charge interest, carries out my regulations and follows my statutes. He will not die for his father’s iniquity; he will surely live.
[Ezek 18:18] As for his father, because he practices extortion, robs his brother, and does what is not good among his people, he will die for his iniquity.

¶[Ezek 18:19] “Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not suffer for his father’s iniquity?’ When the son does what is just and right, and observes all my statutes and carries them out, he will surely live.
[Ezek 18:20] The person who sins is the one who will die. A son will not suffer for his father’s iniquity, and a father will not suffer for his son’s iniquity; the righteous person will be judged according to his righteousness, and the wicked person according to his wickedness.

¶[Ezek 18:21] “But if the wicked person turns from all the sin he has committed and observes all my statutes and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.
[Ezek 18:22] None of the sins he has committed will be held against him; because of the righteousness he has done, he will live.
[Ezek 18:23] Do I actually delight in the death of the wicked, declares the Sovereign Lord? Do I not prefer that he turn from his wicked conduct and live?
[Ezek 18:24] “But if a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and practices wrongdoing according to all the abominable practices the wicked carry out, will he live? All his righteous acts will not be remembered; because of the unfaithful acts he has done and the sin he has committed, he will die.

¶[Ezek 18:25] “Yet you say, ‘The Lord’s conduct is unjust!’ Hear, O house of Israel: Is my conduct unjust? Is it not your conduct that is unjust?
[Ezek 18:26] When a righteous person turns back from his righteousness and practices wrongdoing, he will die for it; because of the wrongdoing he has done, he will die.
[Ezek 18:27] When a wicked person turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will preserve his life.
[Ezek 18:28] Because he considered and turned from all the sins he had done, he will surely live; he will not die.
[Ezek 18:29] Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The Lord’s conduct is unjust!’ Is my conduct unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your conduct that is unjust?
[Ezek 18:30] “Therefore I will judge each person according to his conduct, O house of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and turn from all your wickedness; then it will not be an obstacle leading to iniquity.
[Ezek 18:31] Throw away all your sins you have committed and fashion yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why should you die, O house of Israel?
[Ezek 18:32] For I take no delight in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!
