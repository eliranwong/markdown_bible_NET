# Ezekiel 15

## Parable of the Vine
¶[Ezek 15:1] The Lord’s message came to me:
[Ezek 15:2] “Son of man, of all the woody branches among the trees of the forest, what happens to the wood of the vine?
[Ezek 15:3] Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on?
[Ezek 15:4] No! It is thrown in the fire for fuel; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle, will it be useful for anything?
[Ezek 15:5] Indeed! If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole, how much less can it be made into anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred?
[Ezek 15:6] “Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Like the wood of the vine is among the trees of the forest which I have provided as fuel for the fire – so I will provide the residents of Jerusalem as fuel.
[Ezek 15:7] I will set my face against them – although they have escaped from the fire, the fire will still consume them! Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them.
[Ezek 15:8] I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
