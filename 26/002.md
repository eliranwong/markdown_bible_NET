# Ezekiel 2

## Ezekiel's Call and Mission
¶[Ezek 2:1] He said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak with you.”
[Ezek 2:2] As he spoke to me, a wind came into me and stood me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me.
[Ezek 2:3] He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the house of Israel, to rebellious nations who have rebelled against me; both they and their fathers have revolted against me to this very day.
[Ezek 2:4] The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and hard-hearted, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’
[Ezek 2:5] And as for them, whether they listen or not – for they are a rebellious house – they will know that a prophet has been among them.
[Ezek 2:6] But you, son of man, do not fear them, and do not fear their words – even though briers and thorns surround you and you live among scorpions – do not fear their words and do not be terrified of the looks they give you, for they are a rebellious house!
[Ezek 2:7] You must speak my words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious.

¶[Ezek 2:8] As for you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you: Do not rebel like that rebellious house! Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”
[Ezek 2:9] Then I looked and realized a hand was stretched out to me, and in it was a written scroll.
[Ezek 2:10] He unrolled it before me, and it had writing on the front and back; written on it were laments, mourning, and woe.
