# Isaiah 39

## Hezekiah's Foolish Decision and Babylon's Future
¶`Isa 39:1` At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered.
`Isa 39:2` Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his storehouse with its silver, gold, spices, and high-quality olive oil, as well as his whole armory and everything in his treasuries. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom.
`Isa 39:3` Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where do they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They come from the distant land of Babylon.”
`Isa 39:4` Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” Hezekiah replied, “They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them everything in my treasuries.”
`Isa 39:5` Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the message of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies:
`Isa 39:6` ‘Look, a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the Lord.
`Isa 39:7` ‘Some of your very own descendants whom you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
`Isa 39:8` Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The Lord’s message which you have announced is appropriate.” Then he thought, “For there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.”
