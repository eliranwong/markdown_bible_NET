# 2 Timothy 2

## Strengthening in Ministry
¶[2Tim 2:1] So you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[2Tim 2:2] And what you heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be competent to teach others as well.
[2Tim 2:3] Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
[2Tim 2:4] No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him.
[2Tim 2:5] Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he will not be crowned as the winner unless he competes according to the rules.
[2Tim 2:6] The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops.
[2Tim 2:7] Think about what I am saying and the Lord will give you understanding of all this.
[2Tim 2:8] Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David; such is my gospel,
[2Tim 2:9] for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment as a criminal, but God’s message is not imprisoned!
[2Tim 2:10] So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God, that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory.
[2Tim 2:11] This saying is trustworthy: If we died with him, we will also live with him.
[2Tim 2:12] If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.
[2Tim 2:13] If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.

## Rightly Handling the Word
¶[2Tim 2:14] Remind people of these things and solemnly charge them before the Lord not to wrangle over words. This is of no benefit; it just brings ruin on those who listen.
[2Tim 2:15] Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately.
[2Tim 2:16] But avoid profane chatter, because those occupied with it will stray further and further into ungodliness,
[2Tim 2:17] and their message will spread its infection like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are in this group.
[2Tim 2:18] They have strayed from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining some people’s faith.
[2Tim 2:19] However, God’s solid foundation remains standing, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”
[2Tim 2:20] Now in a wealthy home there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also ones made of wood and of clay, and some are for honorable use, but others for ignoble use.
[2Tim 2:21] So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.
[2Tim 2:22] But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
[2Tim 2:23] But reject foolish and ignorant controversies, because you know they breed infighting.
[2Tim 2:24] And the Lord’s slave must not engage in heated disputes but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient,
[2Tim 2:25] correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth
[2Tim 2:26] and they will come to their senses and escape the devil’s trap where they are held captive to do his will.
