## Azariah's Prosperous and Offensive Reign
¶[2Kgs 15:1] In the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam’s reign over Israel, Amaziah’s son Azariah became king over Judah.
[2Kgs 15:2] He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecholiah, who was from Jerusalem.
[2Kgs 15:3] He did what the Lord approved, just as his father Amaziah had done.
[2Kgs 15:4] But the high places were not eliminated; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on the high places.
[2Kgs 15:5] The Lord afflicted the king with an illness; he suffered from a skin disease until the day he died. He lived in separate quarters, while his son Jotham was in charge of the palace and ruled over the people of the land.

[2Kgs 15:20] Menahem got this silver by taxing all the wealthy men in Israel; he took fifty shekels of silver from each one of them and paid it to the king of Assyria. Then the king of Assyria left; he did not stay there in the land.
[2Kgs 15:21] The rest of the events of Menahem’s reign, including all his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll called the Annals of the Kings of Israel.

[2Kgs 15:25] His officer Pekah son of Remaliah conspired against him. He and fifty Gileadites assassinated Pekahiah, as well as Argob and Arieh, in Samaria in the fortress of the royal palace. Pekah then took his place as king.
